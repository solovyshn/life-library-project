9027232938,"On the Medieval Theory of Signs (Foundations of Semiotics, Vol 21)",Umberto Eco,1989,John Benjamins Publishing Co,History,"In the course of the long debate on the nature and the classification of signs, from Boethius to Ockham, there are at least three lines of thought: the Stoic heritage, that influences Augustine, Abelard, Francis Bacon; the Aristotelian tradition, stemming from the commentaries on ,De Interpretatione;, the discussion of the grammarians, from Priscian to the Modistae. Modern interpreters are frequently misled by the fact that the various authors regularly used the same terms. Such a homogeneous terminology, however, covers profound theoretical differences. The aim of these essays is to show that the medieval theory of signs does not represent a unique body of semiotic notions: there are diverse and frequently alternative semiotic theories. This book thus represents an attempt to encourage further research on the still unrecognized variety of the semiotic approaches offered by the medieval philosophies of language.",4.1,10,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/9027232938.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/9027232938.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/9027232938.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Long a target of J. Edgar Hoover's campaign to defame, infiltrate, and criminalize Black nationalist organizations and their leaders, Shakur was incarcerated for four years prior to her conviction on flimsy evidence in 1977 as an accomplice to murder.,This intensely personal and political autobiography belies the fearsome image of JoAnne Chesimard long projected by the media and the state. With wit and candor, Assata Shakur recounts the experiences that led her to a life of activism and portrays the strengths, weaknesses, and eventual demise of Black and White revolutionary groups at the hand ofÂ government officials. The result is a signal contribution to the literature about growing up Black in America that has already taken its place alongside ,The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and the works of Maya Angelou.,Two years after her conviction, Assata Shakur escaped from prison.

3492207006,Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit.,Sten Nadolny,1987,Piper,Fiction,""",Die Entdeckung der Langsamkeit,"" ist auf den ersten Blick zugleich ein Seefahrerroman, ein Roman Ã¼ber das Abenteuer und die Sehnsucht danach und ein Entwicklungsroman.

Wie bei einem Palimpsest erscheint hinter den SÃ¤tzen eine andere Schrift, hinter der PrÃ¤gnanz und Redlichkeit der AufklÃ¤rung verbergen sich Humor und Traurigkeit der Romantik.,Von Kindheit an trÃ¤umt John Franklin davon, zur See zu fahren, obwohl er dafÃ¼r denkbar ungeeignet ist: Langsam im Sprechen und Denken, langsam in seinen Reaktionen miÃŸt er die Zeit nach eigenen MaÃŸstÃ¤ben. ZunÃ¤chst erkennt nur sein Lehrer, daÃŸ Johns eigenartige Behinderung auch VorzÃ¼ge hat - was er einmal erfaÃŸt hat, das behÃ¤lt er, das Einzigartige, das Detail begreift er besser als andere. John Franklin geht zur Marine, erlebt den Krieg und das Sterben. Beides trifft ihn um so furchtbarer, als er innerhalb des von ihm kaum begriffenen, chaotisch schnellen Geschehens einzelne VorgÃ¤nge wie in Zeitlupe ablaufen sieht. Er trÃ¤umt von friedlicher Entdeckung, will die legendÃ¤re Nordwestpassage finden.",3.96,2821,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3492207006.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3492207006.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3492207006.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Seizing on the striking similarities between the religious vision of this â€œhereticâ€ pharaoh and the teachings of Moses, Sigmund Freud was the first to argue that Moses was in fact an Egyptian. Now Ahmed Osman, using recent archaeological discoveries and historical documents, contends that Akhenaten and Moses were one and the same man. , ,In a stunning retelling of the Exodus story, Osman details the events of Moses/Akhenaten's life: how he was brought up by Israelite relatives, ruled Egypt for seventeen years, angered many of his subjects by replacing the traditional Egyptian pantheon with worship of the Aten, and was forced to abdicate the throne. Retreating to the Sinai with his Egyptian and Israelite supporters, he died out of the sight of his followers, presumably at the hands of Seti I, after an unsuccessful attempt to regain his throne. , ,Osman reveals the Egyptian components in the monotheism preached by Moses as well as his use of Egyptian royal ritual and Egyptian religious expression.

1852425350,It's Dark in London (Mask Noir Series),Oscar Zarate,1997,Serpent's Tail,Sequential Art,"Comics have thrived in London over the centuries with Gilray, Hogarth, the first edition of 'Comick Magazine' in 1976, Thomas Rowlandson's 'Doctor Syntax' in 1809 and the first edition of Punch in 1841. In this century, there have been attempts to reserve comics for kids with the growth of magazines like Dandy and Beano. But the comic strip is too rich an art form to be just for kids - in recent years, a new generation of British artists has developed a rich synthesis of the Continental graphic novel and American comic strips. In It's Dark in London the work of some of these artists is featured - Alan Moore, Ilya, Neil Gaiman, David McKean, Carol Swain, Dix - in tandem with the stories of London writers like Iain Sinclair, Graeme Gordon, Christopher Petit and Stella Duffy. This fusion produces a portrait of London that captures the city's fundamental essence as exquisite mixture of lofty towers and gutter sleaze, of suburban gentility and urban depravity, of private vices and public philanthropy.",3.11,170,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1852425350.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1852425350.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1852425350.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1885705026,"Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence",David Keirsey,1998,Prometheus Nemesis Book Co Inc,Nonfiction,"Phenomenon: Keirsey and Bates's Please Understand Me, first published in 1978, sold nearly 2 million copies in its first 20 years, becoming a perennial best seller all over the world. Advertised only by word of mouth, the book became a favorite training and counseling guide in many institutions -- government, church, business -- and colleges across the nation adopted it as an auxiliary text in a dozen different departments. Why? Perhaps it was the user-friendly way that Please Understand Me helped people find their personality style. Perhaps it was the simple accuracy of Keirsey's portraits of temperament and character types. Or perhaps it was the book's essential message: that members of families and institutions are OK, even though they are fundamentally different from each other, and that they would all do well to appreciate their differences and give up trying to change others into copies of themselves.,Now: Please Understand Me II,For the past twenty years Keirsey has continued to investigate personality differences -- to refine his theory of the four temperaments and to define the facets of character that distinguish one from another. His findings form the basis of Please Understand Me II, an updated and greatly expanded edition of the book, far more comprehensive and coherent than the original, and yet with much of the same easy accessibility. One major addition is Keirsey's view of how the temperaments differ in the intelligent roles they are most likely to develop. Each of us, he says, has four kinds of intelligence -- tactical, logistical, diplomatic, strategic -- though one of the four interests us far more than the others, and thus gets far more practice than the rest. Like four suits in a hand of cards, we each have a long suit and a short suit in what interests us and what we do well, and fortunate indeed are those whose work matches their skills. As in the original book, Please Understand Me II begins with The Keirsey Temperament Sorter, the most used personality inventory in the world. But also included is The Keirsey Four-Types Sorter, a new short questionnaire that identifies one's basic temperament and then ranks one's second, third, and fourth choices.

(At the turn of the century, the Anglo-American population numbered more than thirty thousand.) Why have men and women fleeing sex scandals traditionally settled here? What is it about Florence that has made it so fascinating-and so repellent-to artists and writers over the years?,Moving fleetly between present and past and exploring characters both real and fictional, Leavitt's narrative limns the history of the foreign colony from its origins in the middle of the nineteenth century until its demise under Mussolini, and considers the appeal of Florence to figures as diverse as Tchaikovsky, E.M. Forster, Ronald Firbank, and Mary McCarthy. Lesser-known episodes in Florentine history-the moving of Michelangelo's ,David,, and the construction of temporary bridges by black American soldiers in the wake of the Second World War-are contrasted with images of Florence today (its vast pizza parlors and tourist culture).

1580050700,Expat: Women's True Tales of Life Abroad (Adventura Travel Series),Christina Henry De Tessan,2002,Seal Press (WA),Travel,"For generations, literary figures from Ernest Hemingway to Frances Mayes have fueled our fantasies about the romance of expatriate life. But itâ€™s one thing to dream about living abroad and quite another to actually do it. In Expat a diverse group of women explores in vivid detail how the reality of life abroad matches up to the fantasy. Tonya Ward Singer craves a roasted chicken in China and must buy it alive and kicking. Karen Rosenberg reevaluates both her familyâ€™s Judaism and her own when invited to a Passover seder in a remote Japanese village. Mandy Dowd tries to teach the French about Thanksgiving.

1567184448,In the Circle: Crafting the Witches' Path,Elen Hawke,2001,Llewellyn Publications,Religion,"Daffodils dance in a chilly spring breeze . . . a butterfly alights on a sunny marigold . . . sleepy autumn energy moves through an apple tree . . . in a winter garden, a redstart greedily strips berries from holly. And so the seasons rise and fall, the wheel of the year turns, and the sacred circle of birth, death, and regeneration goes on.,This simple and beautiful guide combines author Elen Hawke's personal accounts of sabbats and moon rites with clear, common sense instruction that makes witchcraft accessible to anyone who wishes to enter the circle.,Journey through the Moon's phases and the eight seasonal festivals; gain an understanding of Goddess and God; learn how to build a shrine, perform ritual, and collect or make magical tools. Evocative and poetic, In the Circle will take you deeper into your inner core, the place where you can connect to the spirit of Nature and to your own innate knowledge.,Tree and bird, stone and star,The spirituality of witchcraft is experienced through the world around us, through Nature and through the bodies in which we live. The sense of the divine is not remote from the world, but is part of one's own being.,To be a witch means living in harmony with the ebb and flow of the seasonal tides and the cycles of Sun, Moon, and weather; to have a love of everything that lives, a respect for and sympathy with tree and bird, stone and star, as well as our fellow humans.,This is expressed through aligning oneself with the unfolding patterns of the ritual year, and the monthly waxing and waning of the moon. Witches believe that working in harmony with these cycles will nourish the spirit of the land while aligning their own spiritual development with the soul of Nature. -Elen Hawke",3.95,39,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567184448.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567184448.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567184448.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
1567182283,Pagans &amp; Christians: The Personal Spiritual Experience,Gus Dizerega,2001,Llewellyn Publications,Religion,"Although Christianity is still a major religious force, there are growing numbers of people in other faiths, including the various Pagan traditions. Some Christians have responded to this trend with fear and derision, while some Pagans have reacted to that fear with anger and mistrust. ,Much of the problem is due to misunderstandings and lack of communication. This can change with Gus diZerega's ""Pagans & Christians."" Here you will find a penetrating and illuminating comparison, showing that neither path has the single correct approach to the Divine. Rather, either or both can be authentic and legitimate expressions of the appreciation of the Ultimate Source of All. ,""Pagans & Christians"" is an ideal way to help bridge what at time seems a wide chasm between Christian and Pagan beliefs. By sharing core ideas of both paths, this book provides a way to give deeper mutual understanding and unity among the religions of the world. ,Although ""Pagans & Christians"" accepts both paths as valid, the book provides a more in-depth explanation of Paganism o Â the minority religion because in some ways, Paganism demands a greater defense and explanation of its beliefs and ideas to dispel misunderstandings. The author is a Third Degree Gardenerian Elder and in ""Pagans & Christians"" has presented nothing less than a brilliant defense of Paganism, clearly showing how it should stand beside all of the major religions of the world as an equal. As part of this defense, diZerega gives a listing of biblical contradictions and Christian philosophical difficulties which can help any Pagan responding to a negative attack, and will help any Christian to view his or her religion as a way, not the way. ,Winner of the 2001 Coalition of Visionary Resources (COVR) Award for Best Non-fiction Book ",3.89,119,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567182283.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567182283.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567182283.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Chisholm,2000,Poisoned Pen Press,Historical,"Sir Robert Carey took up his northern post as Warden of the West March in order to escape the complications of creditors and court life. Trouble, however, is where the dashing Carey, possibly a cousin of the Queen, finds it. ,One black night in 1592, Carey is on night patrol along the unsettled border anchored by the garrison in Carlisle. It's a disaster. First, there's the fugitive he has to hand over to the warring Scots. Next come Wee Colin Elliot's sheep stealers. And then a gun explodes and takes off the hand of one of Carey's men. Back in Carlisle, Carey soon learns more faulty guns lie in the armoury in place of the sound weapons shipped in from Newcastle only last week. When these explosive deathtraps are stolen, he sets off in pursuit of both batches of guns--and the thieves. ,The search ends in Dumfries where King James VI of Scotland--potentially King James I of England when his cousin Elizabeth dies--and his raucous court have assembled. James is as dissolute as ever, lovely Lady Elizabeth Widdrington, Carey's true love, is still shackled to her husband, and seductive Signora Bonnetti takes a serious interest in Carey and in the missing guns. Will the frustrated courtier be gallant enough to flirt with the Signora--and with treason?... ,As wild as the American West, P.F. Chisholm's witty historical detections are also elegantly crafted and historically accurate as they reimagine the life of a real Elizabethan gunslinger.

This is the question that poet Kathleen Norris asks us as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at St. John's Abbey in Minnesota. Part record of her time among the Benedictines, part meditation on various aspects of monastic life, ,The Cloister Walk, demonstrates, from the rare perspective of someone who is both an insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world -- its liturgy, its ritual, its sense of community -- can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives.

1582341354,The Flaneur: A Stroll Through the Paradoxes of Paris,Edmund White,2001,Bloomsbury Publishing (NY),Nonfiction,"Bloomsbury is proud to announce the first title in an occasional series in which some of the world's finest novelists reveal the secrets of the city they know best. These beautifully produced, pocket-sized books will provide exactly what is missing in ordinary travel guides: insights and imagination that lead the reader into those parts of a city no other guide can reach.,A flaneur is a stroller, a loiterer, someone who ambles through a city without apparent purpose but is secretly attuned to the history of the place and in covert search of adventure, esthetic or erotic. Edmund White, who lived in Paris for sixteen years, wanders through the streets and avenues and along the quays, taking us into parts of Paris virtually unknown to visitors and indeed to many Parisians. Entering the Marais evokes the history of Jews in France, just as a visit to the Haynes Grill recalls the presence-festive, troubled-of black Americans in Paris for a century and a half. Gays, Decadents, even Royalists past and present are all subjected to the flaneur's scrutiny. ,Edmund White's ,The Flaneur, is opinionated, personal, subjective. As he conducts us through the bookshops and boutiques, past the monuments and palaces, filling us in on the gossip and background of each site, he allows us to see through the blank walls and past the proud edifices and to glimpse the inner, human drama. Along the way he recounts everything from the latest debates among French law-makers to the juicy details of Colette's life in the Palais Royal, even summoning up the hothouse atmosphere of Gustave Moreau's atelier.

1591020751,"Exiles: Literary Classics (Literary Classics (Amherst, N.Y.).)",James Joyce,2003,Prometheus Books,Classics,"The only extant play by the great Irish novelist, Exiles is of interest both for its autobiographical content and for formal reasons. In the characters and their circumstances details of Joyce's life are evident. The main character, Richard Rowan, the moody, tormented writer who is at odds with both his wife and the parochial Irish society around him, is clearly a portrait of Joyce himself. The character of Rowan's wife, Bertha, is certainly influenced by Joyce's lover and later wife, Nora Barnacle, with whom he left Ireland and lived a seminomadic existence in Zurich, Rome, Trieste, and Paris. As in real life, the play depicts the couple with a young son and, like Joyce, Rowan has returned to Ireland because of his mother's illness and subsequent death.,One can also detect hints of Joyce's interest in Nietzsche in Rowan's flawed pursuit of total individual freedom despite the stifling morals of Irish society. Though wrestling with guilt over his own infidelities, Rowan insists on this personal liberty, not only for himself but for his wife as well, who he knows is tempted by his cousin's amorous overtures.,Joyce's decision to express himself in the form of a play no doubt reflects his long admiration of the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. In the tense dialogue, the largely interior drama focused on the characters' relationships, the undertones of guilt, and the longing for freedom one sees similarities with Ibsen's themes. Also the spare, understated writing style - so unlike Joyce's exuberant, playful, and experimental use of language in his novels - shows the influence of Ibsen's ""naked drama"" (as Joyce described Ibsen's style in a published review). Above all, Joyce emulated the Scandinavian master in making the central issue of his drama the conflict between individual freedom and a demanding, judgmental society. In Exiles the protagonists struggle with the choice between living in defiance of the rigid conventions of Irish society or exile from their homeland.,Though lesser-known, Exiles, written after Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and while Joyce was working on Ulysses, provides interesting insights into the development of the creative gifts of a literary genius.",3.4,1367,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1591020751.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1591020751.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1591020751.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Alarmed at the diabolic evidence of Dillon's drunken, perverted nocturnal hobbies, Lana concludes that Bible Camp is his only hope.,But before you can say ""halleluiah, "" Dillon's salvation materializes -- fabulously shirtless and smoking a French cigarette. Perpetually on the lam, Uncle Max needs a place to hang -- and hide out -- for awhile. Hot on his heels is an entourage that includes his parole officer, Meredith; his sexy mountaineer boyfriend, Serge; and fellow con artist/antiques dealer Jane Nguyen.,Sprung from the proverbial closet, Dillon finds himself under Uncle Max's supervision for the summer. This entails Hitchcock films, Balzac novels, and a crash course in crime as Max and Jane's sidekick.,As July gives way to steamy August and the cops close in, one thing is certain -- for Dillon, nothing will everbe the same again.",3.36,70,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575668475.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575668475.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575668475.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
1575001543,Private Lives of the Pharaohs : Unlocking the Secrets of Egyptian Royalty,Joyce Tyldesley,2001,TV Books,History,"Egyptian civilization, preserved for two thousand years, left a mysterious legacy in the form of human remains, monumental buildings, inscrutable writings, and elaborate tombs. But until recently, Egyptian mummies were considered to be little more than curiosities. Much of our understanding of Egyptian civilization has been gleaned from nineteenth century tomb robbers and twentieth century filmmakers. ""Private Lives of the Pharaohs"" highlights the exciting new developments in medical science that are allowing Egyptologists to extract information from mummified Egyptians. Recent scientific advances, including DNA analysis, endoscopy, and CAT scans, are allowing Egyptologists to bring Egypt's dead ""back to life."" The once-hidden evidence extracted from their bones, hair, and rehydrated skin is unlocking the mysteries of the pyramids, showing us the secrets of Tutankahamen's court, and revealing the use of recreational drugs in the royal household. The result is a breathtaking new look at the Pharaohs and their monumental civilization. Renowned Egyptologist Joyce Tyldesley describes the major secrets that forensic scientists have been able to retrieve from Egypt's famed mummies.,In this fascinating work, Joyce Tydesley brings to life the myths and legends of Eygyptian civilization.",3.77,70,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575001543.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575001543.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575001543.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Taking the advice (and financial support) of a wealthy aunt, he decides to ""toss the tiara and get a life.""

And if a handsome stranger should smile down at him from a nearby window, so much the better. Timothy James Beck's debut novel is detailed, realistic, and continually interesting.

1570628106,Inner Christianity : A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition,RICHARD SMOLEY,2002,Shambhala,Religion,"Inner Christianity , is the first introduction to mystical and esoteric Christianity for the general reader. It speaks from a nonsectarian point of view, unearthing insights from the whole of the Christian tradition, orthodox and heretical, famous and obscure. The esoteric tradition has traditionally searched for meanings that would yield a deeper inner knowledge of the divine. While traditional Christianity draws a timeline from Adam's Fall to the Day of Judgment, the esoteric often sees time as folding in on itself, bringing every point to the here and now. While the Church fought bitterly over dogma, the esoteric borrowed freely from other traditionsâ€”Kabbalah, astrology, and alchemyâ€”in their search for metaphors of inner truth. ,Rather than basing his book around exponents of esoteric doctrine, scholar Richard Smoley concentrates on the questions that are of interest to every searching Christian. How can one attain direct spiritual experience? What does ""the Fall"" really tell us about coming to terms with the world we live in? Can we find salvation in everyday life? How can we ascend, spiritually, through the various levels of existence? What was Christ's true message to humankind? From the Gospel of Thomas to ,A Course in Miracles, , from the Jesus Prayer to alchemy and Tarot, from Origen to Dante to Jung, Richard Smoley sheds the light of an alternative Christianity on these issues and more.",4.16,288,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1570628106.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1570628106.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1570628106.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
1857988884,Crescent City Rhapsody,Kathleen Ann Goonan,2000,Gollancz,Science Fiction,"What would it feel like to live through a biological revolution? Many science fiction writers chronicling a vast technological shift lose sight of the people who would have to deal with it. Not so Kathleen Ann Goonan, whose ,Crescent City Rhapsody, is the third of her Nanotech Cycle novels. Each of her characters is profoundly real, and the things that happen to them are as confusing, awe-inspiring, and terrifying as you might expect. , Goonan's story begins with the assassination of Marie Laveau, New Orleans cyber-entrepreneur and grand-niece of the famous voudoun queen. By prior arrangement, Marie is resurrected into a cloned body and prepares for revenge, but she awakens into a world beset by the Silence--periodic bursts of microchip-destroying radiation from space. Enter Dr. Zeb Aberly, a bipolar astrophysicist whose manic episodes help him understand that the Silence contains an alien message and perhaps the potential to change humanity's biology radically. Meanwhile, in Japan, a young biotechnician seals her fate when she helps steal the recipe for a Universal Assembler, a nanotech tool of fearsome power and destructive capability. The stage is set for a revolution, and Goonan delivers, with complex, interwoven story lines that resemble the rhythms and structure of a jazz composition. , ,Brightly colored lines were inching their way up buildings like plants in a fast-growing jungle. She moved briskly, but her heart was lifeless. She was looking at her past and seeing a future that she was not a part of., People sat leaning against buildings here and there, which was the hardest to see. They were not begging. Their brains were changing., They were adapting to the new city., As cities become organisms, a new generation of profoundly ,different, humans comes of age and hope dawns in Crescent City, and Goonan directs the show with artistic flair. ,Crescent City Rhapsody, is confusing and delightful, a swoony harmony of words swirling around crisply melodic ideas. ,--Therese Littleton",3.65,252,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1857988884.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1857988884.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1857988884.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1559632887,Naturalist,Edward O. Wilson,1994,Shearwater Books,Science,"In ,Naturalist,, Wilson describes for the first time both his growth as a scientist and the evolution of the science he has helped define. He traces the trajectory of his lifeâ€”from a childhood spent exploring the Gulf Coast of Alabama and Florida to life as a tenured professor at Harvardâ€”detailing how his youthful fascination with nature blossomed into a lifelong calling. He recounts with drama and wit the adventures of his days as a student at the University of Alabama and his four decades at Harvard University, where he has achieved renown as both teacher and researcher.,As the narrative of Wilson's life unfolds, the reader is treated to an inside look at the origin and development of ideas that guide today's biological research.

1853264016,The Works of William Wordsworth (Wordsworth Collection),William Wordsworth,1998,NTC/Contemporary Publishing Company,Classics,"William Wordsworth (1771-1850) is the foremost of the English Romantic poets. He was much influenced by the events of the French Revolution in his youth, and he deliberately broke away from the artificial diction of the Augustan and neo-classical tradition of the eighteenth century. He sought to write in the language of ordinary men and women, of ordinary thoughts, sights and sounds, and his early poetry represents this fresh approach to his art. Wordsworth spent most of his adult life in the Lake District with his sister Dorothy and his wife Mary, by whom he had four children. His remarkable autobiographical poem The Prelude was completed in 1805, but was not published until after his death, and it is included in this full edition of Wordsworth's poetry.",4.18,1736,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1853264016.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1853264016.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1853264016.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

8838910987,Il birraio di Preston (La memoria),Andrea Camilleri,1995,Sellerio,Fiction,"Si capisce, leggendo Camilleri, che il suo piacere letterario maggiore, raccontando vicende della provincia siciliana (fatti veri su cui trama e ordisce la finzione, e quindi in sÃ¨ semplici se non fossero intricate dall'essere appunto siciliane), Ã¨ quello di riportare il dialogo vivo. E' un piacere che si comunica immediatamente al lettore, per la particolare forza comica dell'arte di Camilleri; ma assieme al piacere, poichÃ© il linguaggio Ã¨ la casa dell'essere, e con la stessa forza e immediatezza, si comunica una specie di nucleo di veritÃ  sull'essere siciliano. L'iperbole e il paradosso della battuta, cui corrispondono l'amara coscienza dell'assurdo in cui siamo e il dolore sordo per l'immutabilitÃ  di questa condizione. Camilleri inventa poco delle vicende che trasforma sulla pagina in vorticosi caroselli di persone e fatti - e qui il fatto vero, conosciuto dalla celebre ,Inchiesta sulle condizioni della Sicilia, del 1875-76, Ã¨ il susseguirsi di intrighi, delitti e tumulti seguiti alla incomprensibile determinazione del prefetto di Caltanissetta, il toscano Bortuzzi, di inaugurare il teatro di Caltanissetta con una sconosciuta opera lirica, ,Il birraio di Preston,. E anche in questo attenersi al fondo di veritÃ  storica c'Ã¨ probabilmente un senso preciso: in Sicilia non serve attendere che la storia si ripeta per avere la farsa. La storia, per i siciliani, si presenta subito, al suo primo apparire, con la smorfia violenta e assurda della farsa.",3.7,1365,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/8838910987.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/8838910987.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/8838910987.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Il documento presupponeva una cosÃ¬ fitta rete di piÃ¹ o meno deliranti adempimenti burocratico-amministrativi da farmi venir subito voglia di scriverci sopra una storia di fantasia (l'ho terminata nel marzo del 1997). La concessione risale al 1892, cioÃ¨ a una quindicina d'anni dopo i fatti che ho contato nel ,Birraio di Preston, e perciÃ² qualcuno potrebbe domandarmi perchÃ© mi ostino a pistiare e a ripistiare sempre nello stesso mortaio, tirando in ballo, quasi in fotocopia, i soliti prefetti, i soliti questori, ecc. Prevedendo l'osservazione, ho messo le mani avanti. La citazione ad apertura di libro Ã¨ tratta da ,I vecchi e i giovani, di Pirandello e mi pare dica tutto. Nei limiti del possibile, essendo questa storia esattamente datata, ho fedelmente citato ministri, alti funzionari dello stato e rivoluzionari col loro vero nome (e anche gli avvenimenti di cui furono protagonisti sono autentici).

8838914729,Il corso delle cose (La memoria),Andrea Camilleri,1998,Sellerio editore,Fiction,"Il titolo del romanzo prende lo spunto da una frase di Merleau-Ponty, Â«il corso delle cose Ã¨ sinuosoÂ». Frase che si attaglia perfettamente a certa realtÃ  siciliana che abbiamo imparato a conoscere da Capuana a Pirandello, da Brancati a Sciascia. Questa realtÃ  sembra sfuggire tra le mani dell'osservatore, tutta intessuta com'Ã¨ di moventi umani elementari ma oscuri, di gesti cerimoniali che alludono a una seconda natura, a un'ipotesi dell'uomo non misurabile secondo i parametri della logica. La prima virtÃ¹ del romanzo Ã¨ la costruzione: Camilleri sa intrecciare le fila di un Â«misteroÂ» con rara abilitÃ , conducendo il lettore sulle vie pericolose e stregate dell'ipotesi mentale, della domanda continua. Ma reso omaggio a questa abilitÃ , che la pratica drammaturgica puÃ² aver favorito, bisogna sottolineare la densitÃ  dell'atmosfera siciliana evocata e, piÃ¹ ancora, le sottili qualitÃ  della scrittura. Certe ore, certe figure appaiono in piena evidenza grazie a un uso morbido e sornione della parola che forma una sua musica molto riconoscibile.

Dass er auch zeitkritische Romane geschrieben hat, wissen die wenigsten. Der Roman ,Fabian, entstand 1931 und beschreibt den moralischen und geistigen Verfall inmitten schwieriger politischer VerhÃ¤ltnisse. FÃ¼r KÃ¤stner gehen in dieser Zeit politischer und moralischer Verfall der Gesellschaft Hand in Hand., Fabian ist ein arbeitsloser Germanist, der durch die GroÃŸstadt Berlin zieht auf der Suche nach Arbeit, auf der Suche nach Kontakten. Wir erleben mit, wie er Menschen trifft, die ihn kaufen wollen, wie sich seine Freundin prostituiert, um Schauspielerin zu werden. Sein bester Freund begeht Selbstmord wegen einer lÃ¤cherlichen Bemerkung. Ein Erfinder tritt auf, der seine Erfindungen, die ArbeitsplÃ¤tze vernichtet haben, zurÃ¼cknehmen will, was nicht geht. Die Stadt ist in AuflÃ¶sung begriffen, die Menschen leben wie in einem Irrenhaus, einem hoffnungslosen, unbarmherzigen Labyrinth., Fabian ist ein AuÃŸenseiter, ein Moralist, seine Waffe ist die Beobachtung, die Distanz, die durch sarkastische Bemerkungen hergestellt wird. Sein Anspruch besteht darin, zuzusehen, ""ob die Welt Talent zur AnstÃ¤ndigkeit hat"". KÃ¤stner stellt dem Moralisten Fabian, ein Mensch Ã¼brigens, der moralisch integer ist, ohne dass ihm dies als Lebensentwurf bewusst ist oder er den Zeigefinger erhebt, menschliche Korrumpierbarkeit, Gewissenlosigkeit und Anpassung entgegen. So finden sich im Buch eine ganze Reihe von wirklich gelungenen satirischen Spitzen, wie z.B. eine Tombola, bei der Nahrungsmittel verlost werden oder eine PÃ¶belei von Menschen als Abendunterhaltung. KÃ¤stners Beschreibungen der Menschen sind bissig und schonungslos. Charakteristisch fÃ¼r die Moral der Menschen ist das Verhalten des Redakteurs MÃ¼ntzer, der etwas unterstÃ¼tzt, an das er nicht glaubt und dessen Falschheit er durchschaut. Von MÃ¼ntzer heiÃŸt es, dass er sein Gewissen chloroformiert hat. , ,Fabian, ist ein Roman mit vielen wirklich gelungenen zeitkritischen Beobachtungen, die auch heute nichts von ihrer AktualitÃ¤t verloren haben. SchlieÃŸlich steht im Zentrum von KÃ¤stners Gesellschaftskritik die menschliche SchwÃ¤che, die Lethargie, genau um die Falschheit der VerhÃ¤ltnisse zu wissen, aber nichts dagegen zu tun -- und diese Kritik hat auch heute nichts von seiner Berechtigung verloren. ,--Christoph Steven",4.13,4126,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3423110066.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3423110066.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3423110066.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1885983395,The Deposition of Father McGreevy,Brian O'Doherty,1999,Turtle Point Press,Cultural,"In a London pub in the 1950s, editor William Maginn is intrigued by a reference to the reputedly shameful demise of a remote mountain village in Kerry, Ireland, where he was born. Maginn returns to Kerry and uncovers an astonishing tale: both the account of the destruction of a place and a way of life which once preserved Ireland's ancient traditions, and the tragedy of an increasingly isolated village where the women mysteriously die-leaving the priest, Father McGreevy, to cope with insoluble problems. Looking back in time, the book traces how, as World War II rages through Europe, McGreevy struggles to preserve what remains of his parish, and struggles against the rough mountain elements, the grief and superstitions of his people, and the growing distrust in the town below. The Deposition of Father McGreevy is a remarkable story, and a gripping exploration of both the locus of misfortune and the nature of evil. Rich in the details of Irish lore and life, its narrative evokes both a time and a place with the accuracy of a keen, unsentimental eye, and renders its characters with heartfelt depth.",3.44,260,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1885983395.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1885983395.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1885983395.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1565928717,Building Internet Firewalls (2nd Edition),Elizabeth D. Zwicky,2000,O'Reilly,Science,"In the five years since the first edition of this classic book was published, Internet use has exploded. The commercial world has rushed headlong into doing business on the Web, often without integrating sound security technologies and policies into their products and methods. The security risks--and the need to protect both business and personal data--have never been greater. We've updated ,Building Internet Firewalls, to address these newer risks.,What kinds of security threats does the Internet pose? Some, like password attacks and the exploiting of known security holes, have been around since the early days of networking. And others, like the distributed denial of service attacks that crippled Yahoo, E-Bay, and other major e-commerce sites in early 2000, are in current headlines.,Firewalls, critical components of today's computer networks, effectively protect a system from most Internet security threats. They keep damage on one part of the network--such as eavesdropping, a worm program, or file damage--from spreading to the rest of the network. Without firewalls, network security problems can rage out of control, dragging more and more systems down.,Like the bestselling and highly respected first edition, ,Building Internet Firewalls, , 2nd Edition, is a practical and detailed step-by-step guide to designing and installing firewalls and configuring Internet services to work with a firewall.

1566635055,Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass,Theodore Dalrymple,2003,Ivan R. Dee Publisher,Nonfiction,"Here is a searing account-probably the best yet published-of life in the underclass and why it persists as it does. Theodore Dalrymple, a British psychiatrist who treats the poor in a slum hospital and a prison in England, has seemingly seen it all. Yet in listening to and observing his patients, he is continually astonished by the latest twist of depravity that exceeds even his own considerable experience. Dalrymple's key insight in Life at the Bottom is that long-term poverty is caused not by economics but by a dysfunctional set of values, one that is continually reinforced by an elite culture searching for victims. This culture persuades those at the bottom that they have no responsibility for their actions and are not the molders of their own lives. Drawn from the pages of the cutting-edge political and cultural quarterly City Journal, Dalrymple's book draws upon scores of eye-opening, true-life vignettes that are by turns hilariously funny, chillingly horrifying, and all too revealing-sometimes all at once. And Dalrymple writes in prose that transcends journalism and achieves the quality of literature.",4.21,2459,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1566635055.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1566635055.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1566635055.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

3442304989,Cave Canem. Ein Felidae- Roman.,Akif Pirincci,1999,Goldmann,Mystery," Eine Serie brutaler Morde an Katzen und Hunden erschÃ¼ttert das Revier. Die tÃ¶dlichen Verletzungen der Opfer lassen keine genauen RÃ¼ckschlÃ¼sse darauf zu, ob Hund oder Katze als SerienmÃ¶rder zuschlÃ¤gt. Die Situation eskaliert. Beide VÃ¶lker beschuldigen sich gegenseitig der Untaten -- eine blutige Auseinandersetzung scheint unvermeidlich., Ein ""Gipfeltreffen"" der verfeindeten Lager wird als letzte Vermittlungsinstanz angesetzt. Dabei entpuppen sich jedoch gerade die FÃ¼hrer beider Parteien als groÃŸe Demagogen, die geschickt den tiefverwurzelten HaÃŸ zwischen Hund und Katze zu schÃ¼ren wissen. Gewalt soll offenbar die Lage ""klÃ¤ren"". Dennoch wird zunÃ¤chst der begnadete SchnÃ¼ffler Francis beauftragt, den MÃ¶rder dingfest zu machen. FÃ¼r ihn selbst hat das Ganze allerdings mehrere Haken: ihm bleiben nur wenige Stunden Zeit, bevor Hund und Katz Ã¼bereinander herfallen werden; er bringt sich selbst in allerhÃ¶chste Gefahr; und er muÃŸ sich zwecks Ausgewogenheit einen Hundepartner gefallen lassen, dessen Geruch allein ihn schon in die Flucht schlagen kÃ¶nnte. Doch die beiden mÃ¼ssen sich arrangieren..., Pirinccis Held Francis ist ein eitler Typ, nicht vorurteilsfrei, selbstbewuÃŸt bis zur Schmerzgrenze, unertrÃ¤glich zynisch, ein Frauenheld und doch auch ein groÃŸer Moralist. Hinter seinen coolen SprÃ¼chen ist die tiefe Sehnsucht nach einem glÃ¼cklichen Leben in einer schÃ¶neren und gerechteren Welt deutlich spÃ¼rbar. Francis wird in diesem Abenteuer einiges zu lernen haben., Akif Pirincci hat seinem neuen Roman keine einfachen Themen zugrunde gelegt, nÃ¤mlich Krieg, RassenhaÃŸ, ethnische Konflikte und -- Freundschaft. Dennoch ist ihm der Balanceakt zwischen problematischen Inhalten und dem Unterhaltungsanspruch des Lesers glÃ¤nzend geglÃ¼ckt. Bei aller spannenden Unterhaltung fÃ¤llt den Leser dieser Parabel immer wieder die Erkenntnis einer schrecklichen RealitÃ¤t an, die sich auch in unmittelbarer europÃ¤ischer Nachbarschaft immer wieder abspielt.

Alles ist sofort umsetzbar, bis hin zu den Tipps zum Umgang mit der Informationsflut. Die Botschaft: Unordentlich zu sein, ist kein Schicksal, sondern vergleichbar mit einer leichten Sucht. Wer sich Ã¤ndern mÃ¶chte, kann es schaffen., Aufgebaut ist das Buch nach dem Schema einer ""Lebenspyramide"": Erste Aufgabe und damit quasi der Sockel der Pyramide ist, seinen Arbeitsplatz zu entwirren und seine Umgebung zu entrÃ¼mpeln. KÃ¼stenmacher begleitet seine Leser buchstÃ¤blich durch jeden Raum der Wohnung. Sein Rezept: Vieles, was man besitzt, benutzt man lÃ¤ngst nicht mehr und braucht man auch nicht; es ist Ballast, der einen buchstÃ¤blich belastet. Weniger Sachen bedeuten mehr Geld und mehr Wahlfreiheit. Also wird aussortiert, wenn nÃ¶tig radikal., Der nÃ¤chste Schritt sind die Finanzen. Hat man sich erfolgreich entschuldet, vom Lotto-Traum verabschiedet und den ""inneren Kontostand"" auf einen positiven Wert gesetzt, heiÃŸt es, in seinem Leben eine Zeitschneise frei zu schlagen. ""Entperfektionieren"" lautet die Devise. Da der Druck oft genug von auÃŸen kommt, liefert der Autor gleich ""Sieben Wege, das Nein beziehungsorientiert zu verkaufen"" mit. Nicht leugnen lÃ¤sst sich, dass auch Beziehungen und Partnerschaft das Leben deutlich komplizierter machen. KÃ¼stenmacher leitet dazu an, seine Familienbande zu entwirren, GesprÃ¤che zu entdramatisieren und das VerhÃ¤ltnis von Beruf und Privatleben zu entkrampfen. Wie ausfÃ¼hrlich die RatschlÃ¤ge sind, zeigt sich an einzelnen SkurrilitÃ¤ten wie der Simplify-Idee Nr. 22: ""Entkrampfen Sie Ihre Beerdigung."" Der wirklich gut organisierte Mensch macht sogar seinen Nachkommen das Leben leichter., Von den einzelnen Bereichen geht es zum groÃŸen Ganzen: Die Spitze der Pyramide bilden Tipps, wie man sich selbst vereinfacht, indem man sein Lebensziel entdeckt, seine StÃ¤rken entwickelt und sich selbst entrÃ¤tselt. Denn eine chaotische Wohnung, anstrengende Beziehungen und ein Konto, das stÃ¤ndig in den Miesen ist, sind nicht selten Ausdruck einer PersÃ¶nlichkeit, die nicht im inneren Einklang ist. ,--Sylvia Englert",3.57,659,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3593368188.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3593368188.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3593368188.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

But this play-within-a-play is not historical drama. Its thought is as modern as today's police states and The Bomb; its theatrical impact has everywhere been called a major innovation. It is total theatre: philosophically problematic, visually terrifying. It engages the eye, the ear, and the mind with every imaginable dramatic device, technique, and stage picture, even including song and dance. All the forces and elements possible to the stage are fused in one overwhelming experience. This is theatre such as has rarely been seen before. The play is basically concerned with the problem of revolution. Are the same things true for the masses and for their leaders? And where, in modern times, lie the borderlines of sanity?",4.03,4321,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1577662318.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1577662318.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1577662318.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1400051290,The Sense of Being Stared At : And Other Unexplained Powers of the Human Mind,RUPERT SHELDRAKE,2004,Three Rivers Press,Science,"Most of us know it well--the almost physical sensation that we are the object of someoneâ€™s attention. Is the feeling all in our heads? What about related phenomena, such as telepathy and premonitions? Are they merely subjective beliefs? In ,The Sense of Being Stared At,, renowned biologist Rupert Sheldrake explores the intricacies of the mind and discovers that our perceptive abilities are stronger than most of us could have imagined.,Sheldrake argues persuasively in this compelling book that such phenomena are, in fact, real. He rejects the label of ""paranormal"" and shows how these psychic occurrences are in fact a normal part of human nature. Combining the tradition of pragmatic experimentation with a refusal to accept the conventional answers to explain such phenomena, Sheldrake pioneers an intriguing new inquiry into the mysteries of our deepest nature. Rigorously researched yet completely accessible, this groundbreaking book provides a refreshing new way of thinking about ourselves and our relationships with other people, animals, and the world around us.,There are 4 parts:,Part 1: Telepathy,Part 2: The Power of Attention,Part 3: Remote Viewing and Foreshadowings of the Future,Part 4: How does the 7th Sense Work?,The book begins by explaining how the ""Sixth Sense"" has already been claimed by biologists working on the electrical and magnetic senses of animals. Eels use electrical fields to sense objects around them, sharks and rays use similar fields to hunt, migratory birds and fish have a magnetic senses (biological compass), snakes have heat-sensing abilities, spiders detect web vibrations, etc.,Mr. Sheldrake explains how the 7th sense is biological, not supernatural. It extends beyond the body, though how is not exactly known. ""To brush aside what people have experienced is not to be scientific, but unscientific. Science is founded on empirical method..."" (experience and observation). ""But despite an impresssive accumulation of evidence, psychic research has never been accepted within institutional sciences. It has been kept on the margins as a result of powerful taboos against the ""paranormal."",""In the background lurks the archaic fear of witchcraft.""",3.76,408,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051290.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051290.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051290.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

With their flagrant criminal violation of society's rules, serial killers like Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy are among the most dramatic examples of the psychopath. Individuals with this personality disorder are fully aware of the consequences of their actions and know the difference between right and wrong, yet they are terrifyingly self-centered, remorseless, and unable to care about the feelings of others. Perhaps most frightening, they often seem completely normal to unsuspecting targets--and they do not always ply their trade by killing. Presenting a compelling portrait of these dangerous men and women based on 25 years of distinguished scientific research, Dr. Robert D. Hare vividly describes a world of con artists, hustlers, rapists, and other predators who charm, lie, and manipulate their way through life. Are psychopaths mad, or simply bad?

1400046130,If a Place Can Make You Cry : Dispatches from an Anxious State,DANIEL GORDIS,2002,Crown,Nonfiction,"In the summer of 1998, Daniel Gordis and his family moved to Israel from Los Angeles. They planned to be there for a year, during which time Daniel would be a Fellow at the Mandel Institute in Jerusalem. This was a euphoric time in Israel. The economy was booming, and peace seemed virtually guaranteed. A few months into their stay, Gordis and his wife decided to remain in Israel permanently, confident that their children would be among the first generation of Israelis to grow up in peace.,Immediately after arriving in Israel, Daniel had started sending out e-mails about his and his familyâ€™s life to friends and family abroad. These missivesâ€”passionate, thoughtful, beautifully written, and informativeâ€”began reaching a much broader readership than heâ€™d ever envisioned, eventually being excerpted in The New York Times Magazine to much acclaim. An edited and finely crafted collection of his original e-mails, ,If a Place Can Make You Cry, is a first-person, immediate account of Israelâ€™s post-Oslo meltdown that cuts through the rhetoric and stridency of most dispatches from that country or from the international media. ,Above all, Gordis tells the story of a family that must cope with the sudden realization that they took their children from a serene and secure neighborhood in Los Angeles to an Israel not at peace but mired in war. This is the chronicle of a loss of innocenceâ€”the innocence of Daniel and his wife, and of their children. Ultimately, through Gordisâ€™s eyes, Israel, with all its beauty, madness, violence, and history, comes to life in a way weâ€™ve never quite seen before.,Daniel Gordis captures as no one has the years leading up to what every Israeli dreaded: on April 1, 2002, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared that Israel was at war. After an almost endless cycle of suicide bombings and harsh retaliation, any remaining chance for peace had seemingly died.,If a Place Can Make You Cry, is the story of a time in which peace gave way to war, when childhood innocence evaporated in the heat of hatred, when it became difficult even to hope. Like countless other Israeli parents, Gordis and his wife struggled to make their childrenâ€™s lives manageable and meaningful, despite it all. This is a book about what their children gained, what they lost, and how, in the midst of everything, a whole family learned time and again what really matters.,From the Hardcover edition.",4.24,158,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400046130.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400046130.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400046130.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

3518118188,Mutmassungen Ã?Â¼ber Jakob.,Uwe Johnson,1992,Suhrkamp,Cultural,"Uwe Johnsons erster verÃ¶ffentlichter Roman ist wegen seiner komplexen ErzÃ¤hlkonstruktion ein schwieriges Buch, das durch seine Thematik (die deutsche Teilung) den jungen Nachkriegsautor und GrenzgÃ¤nger aus Ostdeutschland sogleich bekannt machte.,Entstehung: Johnsons Mutter arbeitete bei der Reichsbahn als Schaffnerin, dann beim GÃ¼tertransport. Nach ihrer Flucht konnte der Sohn weiter in der GÃ¼strower Bahnkantine essen. So lernte er die Arbeitswelt kennen. Nach Schwierigkeiten, erste Romanskripte drucken zu lassen, schrieb Johnson zwischen dem 6.2. und dem 4.12.1958 an dem Buch, das zunÃ¤chst Â»Guten Tag, JakobÂ« heiÃŸen und unter dem Pseudonym Joachim Catt erscheinen sollte.,Inhalt: Jakob Abs, 28 Jahre alt, stammt aus Mecklenburg und ist Beamter bei der DDR-Reichsbahn in Dresden. Im November 1956 wird er auf dem RangiergelÃ¤nde von einer Lok Ã¼berfahren. Ob sein Tod ein Unfall im Nebel, Selbstmord oder gar von den BehÃ¶rden geplant war, kann nur Gegenstand von Â»MutmaÃŸungenÂ« sein, welche die Vorgeschichte erhellen.,Der fleiÃŸige, ruhige, kollegiale, loyale, gegenÃ¼ber der DDR-Politik vorsichtige und gegenÃ¼ber Westdeutschland eher skeptische Abs wird von der Spionageabwehr Ã¼berwacht, seit seine Mutter und seine Freundin Gesine Cresspahl, die nun fÃ¼r die NATO arbeitet, sich in den Westen abgesetzt haben.,Die Handlung ist geprÃ¤gt von der HalbdurchlÃ¤ssigkeit des Eisernen Vorhangs in der kurzen Tauwetter-Periode, die nach dem Ungarn-Aufstand 1956 â€“ Jakob muss als Eisenbahner die sowjetischen MilitÃ¤rtransporte bemerken â€“ wieder endet: Gesine besucht ihren Vater Heinrich und Jakob, wobei sie vom Abwehr-Hauptmann Rohlfs unter Druck gesetzt wird. WÃ¤hrend er den regimekritischen, in Gesine verliebten Hochschulassistenten Dr. Blach verhaftet, lÃ¤sst Rohlfs das Paar Cresspahl-Abs an der langen Leine, um beide mÃ¶glichst ohne Gewalt zu gewinnen (Aktion Â»Taube auf dem DachÂ«), so dass Jakob sogar in den Westen reisen kann, von wo er trotz Gesines Liebe freiwillig zurÃ¼ckkehrt und am selben Tag stirbt.,Aufbau: Die mysteriÃ¶se, aber unspektakulÃ¤re, fÃ¼r die Schwierigkeiten der innerdeutschen Beziehungen, seien sie privat oder politisch, typische Geschichte aus dem gut beobachteten und durch Fachsprache lebendig gemachten Eisenbahneralltag verfÃ¤hrt analytisch und ist keinesfalls linear erzÃ¤hlt. Ã„hnlich Max R Frischs Figur Stiller muss Jakob Abs von anderen rekonstruiert werden. Daher besteht der grÃ¶ÃŸte Teil der fÃ¼nf Kapitel aus BruchstÃ¼cken von GesprÃ¤chen zwischen dem Kollegen JÃ¶che und Jonas Blach, zwischen diesem und Gesine, zwischen dieser und Rohlfs sowie aus kursiv gesetzten inneren Monologen, die der Leser in einem Rekonstruktionsspiel Jakobs Kontaktpersonen zuweisen muss. Hinzu kommen Passagen, in denen ein ErzÃ¤hler den Zusammenhang herstellt, jedoch nicht so, dass am Schluss eine LÃ¶sung fÃ¼r den Anfang stÃ¼nde: Â»Aber Jakob ist doch immer quer Ã¼ber die Gleise gegangen.Â« Der Zwang zu Â»MutmaÃŸungenÂ« Ã¼bertrÃ¤gt sich von den beteiligten Personen, die ihre Rolle oder Schuld mitreflektieren, auf die Leser. Die Sprache mit ihren AnklÃ¤ngen plattdeutscher MÃ¼ndlichkeit charakterisiert in Satzbau und Grammatik die Figuren. BibelanklÃ¤nge durchziehen, bei Jakobs Namen beginnend, das Buch und verleihen ihm eine Ã¼berzeitliche Dimension. FÃ¼r den Autor war das komplizierte ErzÃ¤hlen kein Formalismus, sondern adÃ¤quater Ausdruck der deutschen VerhÃ¤ltnisse,Wirkung: Das Buch, als kritischer Beitrag zur eigenstÃ¤ndigen DDR-Literatur konzipiert, erregte Aufsehen, da Johnson bald nach der VerÃ¶ffentlichung durch den Frankfurter Suhrkamp Verlag in den Westen Ã¼bersiedelte. Die DDR ignorierte es 20 Jahre lang; allerdings kann man den Roman Der geteilte Himmel (1963) von Christa R Wolf als gezielten Gegenentwurf lesen.

The good news is that you don't have to do it alone-the tarot can give you advice when you need it most! ,Reading the tarot for advice requires a different approach than reading for prediction. ""Tarot: Your Everyday Guide ""presents a new method of tarot interpretation. You'll learn how to use the tarot to help you make an informed decision and determine a course of action for just about any life situation. ,For example, in an advice reading the Two of Wands could mean you should set up your own challenges to work out goals, define issues, and work out compromises. If the King of Cups comes up in an advice reading, it means you must give encouragement, acknowledge the accomplishments of others, give rewards, and let others enjoy the limelight. Alternatively, it could mean you need to seek a mentor who has these qualities. The position of a given card within a spread, and the cards before and after it, will clarify the cards' advice for you. ,You can even use advice readings to augment traditional divination. If a divinatory spread shows trouble ahead, consult the cards for advice on how to avoid the situation or lessen its impact. ,Whether you're an experienced tarot reader or have never even shuffled the cards before, this unique and practical book will open new doors of understanding and help you integrate the rich symbolism of the tarot into your daily life. ,Winner of the 2001 Coalition of Visionary Resources (COVR) Award for best Self-help Book ",4.25,55,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567185657.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567185657.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567185657.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1891369199,The Walker's Literary Companion,Roger Gilbert,2000,Breakaway Books,Travel,"Preface,Going out for a long walk, the nineteenth-century novelist and essayist Robert Louis Stevenson would bring with him the classic English walking essay, William Hazlitt's ""On Going a Journey"" (1821), about which he claimed, passionately if dogmatically, it is ""so good that there should be a tax levied on all who have not read it."" Imagine being so taken with an essay on walking! But history, at least of a past two hundred years, reveals that walkers have loved to read about their passion; and-given the perennial market for magazine essays and fictions, poems, and novels either describing a walk or set on a walk-that non-walking readers also like to imagine life occurring on the path or pavement.,The three editors have in common a love of walking and love of the literature of walking. We are all university scholars who have written books on literature and walking, and through this last connection have come to know one another. The mutually infectious nature of the subject and our dedication to it led to the present volume. To this end we have walked the streets of Manhattan and around the Central Park Reservoir, huddled in a Chicago hotel room, and tramped the bluffs on the Northern California coast, culling from memory our favorite walking pieces from the great collective wellspring of human writing.,We have composed our anthology for both pedestrian and non-pedestrian readers. Is there a person alive, except for the physically disabled, who is not a walker? Everyone walks, but we address those who ,love, walking, either on the ground or in the imagination. When about 100 years ago he compiled ,The Lore of the Wanderer: An Open-Air Anthology,, a small plain blue-covered book one could put in a back pocket, George Goodchild-in perhaps the first of a substantial cluster of such collections-caught the spirit of our end-of-this-century volume: a book (a companion) to be taken with you; or, if you cannot get out for a walk, you can read one at home.,There are, however, important differences between Goodchild's collection and ours.

Kaum irgendwo in der Literatur gibt es prÃ¤zisere und schÃ¤rfere Analysen der magischen, faszinierenden und nicht selten desastrÃ¶sen Interaktion zwischen Mann und Frau, als in diesen drei ErzÃ¤hlungen.,Drei Frauen, sie stehen auf den ersten Blick zwar nicht im Mittelpunkt der Episoden â€“ denn das scheinen die zugehÃ¶rigen MÃ¤nner zu sein â€“, doch sie dominieren und bestimmen das Geschehen: Die BÃ¤uerin Grigia, die portugiesische Aristokratin und die VerkÃ¤uferin Tonka. Drei MÃ¤nner erleiden durch diese Frauen ihre Tragik und ihr Schicksal.,Diese Novellen sind Meisterwerke, fundamental in der Konstruktion, brillant in der Sprache.,Ãœber den Autor:,Robert Musil wurde am 6. November 1880 in Klagenfurt geboren. Sein Vater sah fÃ¼r ihn die MilitÃ¤rlaufbahn vor und schickte ihn auf verschiedene MilitÃ¤rakademien. Er brach jedoch die Offizierslaufbahn ab und studierte â€“ nach einem Intermezzo im Maschinenbaustudium â€“ ab 1903 in Berlin Philosophie und Psychologie, und bekam dort ersten Zugang zu KÃ¼nstlerkreisen. 1910 geht Musil zurÃ¼ck nach Wien. Nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg, an dem er teilnahm, festigt er seinen Ruf als Schriftsteller, und wird mit diversen Preisen ausgezeichnet, u.a. dem Kleist-Preis fÃ¼r das Schauspiel Â»Die SchwÃ¤rmerÂ«. 1920 lernt er in Berlin seinen kÃ¼nftigen Verleger, Ernst Rowohlt kennen, der ihn in den nÃ¤chsten 20 Jahren, wÃ¤hrend Musil am Â»Mann ohne EigenschaftenÂ« arbeitet, mit VorschÃ¼ssen finanziell unterstÃ¼tzen wird. Musil publiziert nun fast nichts anderes mehr, setzt all seine Kraft in sein Monumentalwerk.,Mit dem Â»AnschlussÂ« Ã–sterreichs an den Nationalsozialismus im Jahr 1938 werden Musils BÃ¼cher nach Deutschland nun auch in Ã–sterreich verboten. Er emigriert mit seiner Frau in die Schweiz, zunÃ¤chst wohnen sie in ZÃ¼rich, spÃ¤ter bei Genf. â€“ Am 15. April 1942 stirbt Robert Musil an einem Gehirnschlag.

With a masterful and entertaining eye, Desmond Morris, bestselling author of ,The Naked Ape, and ,The Human Zoo,, analyzes the roots of human intimacy, from the handshake through the twelve stages that people pass through on their way to the total sexual embrace. Morris contends that the months just before and after birth are when the seeds of intimacy are planted and are critical to development. From the loving attention of the mother, the child learns and responds with intimate gestures of his or her own. He argues that human adults follow certain patterns of intimate behaviour that are based on these infant experiences for their entire lives. In addition to sexual intimacy, Morris discussed social intimacy, intimacy substitutes, object intimacy, and self-intimacy. Complete with a new preface by the author, ,Intimate Behavior, is a provocative view of humans need to touch and to be touched, to love and to be loved. At a crucial moment, a gentle embrace can still do more good than a thousand earnest discussions. Despite all our social and technological advances, the primeval body language of love still remains the most potent force we have for the expression of feelings of comfort and caring.

Em jovem aderiu aos ideais do Liberalismo e foi obrigado, por seu pai, a sair de casa e a instalar-se em Inglaterra. ApÃ³s o pai falecer regressa a Lisboa para casar com Maria Eduarda Runa, mas pouco tempo depois escolhe o exÃ­lio por razÃµes de ordem polÃ­tica. HÃ¡ em ,Os Maias, um retrato da Lisboa da epÃ³ca. Carlos, que mora na Rua das Janelas Verdes, caminha com frequÃªncia atÃ© ao Rossio (embora, por vezes, vÃ¡ a cavalo ou de carruagem). Algumas das lojas citadas no livro ainda existem - a Casa Havaneza, no Chiado, por exemplo. Ã‰ possÃ­vel seguir os diferentes percursos de Carlos ou do Ega pelas suas da Baixa lisboeta, ainda que algumas tenham mudado de nome. No final do livro, quando Carlos volta a Lisboa muitos anos depois, somos levados a ver as novidades - a Avenida da Liberdade, que substituiu o Passeio PÃºblico, e que Ã© descrita como uma coisa nova, e feia pela sua novidade, exactamente como nos anos 70 se falava das casas de emigrante. O romance veicula sobre o paÃ­s uma perspectiva muito derrotista, muito pessimista. Tirando a natureza (o Tejo, Sintra, Santa OlÃ¡via...), Ã© tudo uma choldra ignÃ³bil. Predomina uma visÃ£o de estrangeirado, de quem sÃ³ valoriza as civilizaÃ§Ãµes superiores - da FranÃ§a e Inglaterra, principalmente. Os polÃ­ticos sÃ£o mesquinhos, ignorantes ou corruptos (Gouvarinho, Sousa Neto...); os homens das Letras sao boÃ©mios e dissolutos, retrÃ³grados ou distantes da realidade concreta (Alencar, Ega...: lembre-se o que se passou no Sarau do Teatro da Trindade); os jornalistas boÃ©mios e venais (Palma...); os homens do desporto nÃ£o conseguem organizar uma corrida de cavalos, pois nÃ£o hÃ¡ hipÃ³dromo Ã  altura, nem cavalos, nem cavaleiros, as pessoas nÃ£o vestem como o evento exigia, as senhoras traziam vestidos de missa. Para cÃºmulo de tudo isto, os protagonistas acabam vencidos da vida. Apesar de ser isto referido no fim do livro, pode-se ver que ainda hÃ¡ alguma esperanca implÃ­cita, nas passagens em que Carlos da Maia e JoÃ£o da Ega dizem que o apetite humano Ã© a causa de todos os seus problemas e que portanto nunca mais terÃ£o apetites, mas logo a seguir dizem que lhes estÃ¡ a apetecer um ""prato de paio com ervilhas,"" ou quando dizem que a pressa nÃ£o leva a nada e que a vida deve ser levada com calma mas comeÃ§am a correr para apanhar o americano (elÃ©ctrico). Mais do que crÃ­tica de costumes, o romance mostra-nos um paÃ­s - sobretudo Lisboa - que se dissolve, incapaz de se regenerar. Quando o autor escreve mais tarde ,A Cidade e as Serras,, expÃµe uma atitude muito mais construtiva: o protagonista regenera-se pela descoberta das raÃ­zes rurais ancestrais nÃ£o atingidas pela degradaÃ§Ã£o da civilizaÃ§Ã£o, num movimento inverso ao que predomina n',Os Maias,.",4.02,18418,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/9725681363.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/9725681363.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/9725681363.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1590170105,A Bolt from the Blue and Other Essays,Mary McCarthy,2002,New York Review of Books,Nonfiction,"Mary McCarthy was one of the leading literary figures of her time. In addition to the novels and memoirs for which she is best remembered, she was also a tireless literary and social critic. Starting out as a theater reviewer for ""Partisan Review"" in 1937, she quickly distinguished herself for her witty and fearless commentary on topics ranging from McCarthyism to the French New Novel to women's fashion magazines. McCarthy was an eager controversialist, unsparing in her dissection of anything she found phony or hypocritical. Her reviews are sharp, sometimes malicious, and often very funny, but her criticism is also informed by deep erudition and enlivened by an inexhaustible capacity for enthusiasm. Her political writings, critical in equal measure of the Cold War consensus and of its critics, are less concerned with finding correct positions than with exploring the often absurd circumstances in which agonizing moral decisions are made. ,While the soundness of McCarthy's judgments can sometimes be doubted, her curiosity and intelligence cannot. The intellectual brio and acute judgment that characterizes her best fiction is vividly displayed in this selection of essays, which span McCarthy's career from the late 1930s to the late 1970s. It includes her writings on topics such as fashion magazines, Eugene O'Neill, ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""Look Back in Anger,"" ""Pale Fire,"" J.D. Salinger, Madame Bovary, Italo Calvino, and Watergate. The volume constitutes not only a valuable record of the ideological and cultural controversies that dominated American intellectual life from the Moscow trials to the Watergate hearings, but will also introduce a new generation of readers to a uniquelyforthright and vibrant critical voice.",3.77,509,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1590170105.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1590170105.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1590170105.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

3540601910,The Sea Floor,E. Seibold,1996,Springer-Verlag,Science,"Man's understanding of how this planet is put together and how it evolved has changed radically during the last 30 years. This great revolution in geology - now usually subsumed under the concept of Plate Tectonics - brought the realization that convection within the Earth is responsible for the origin of today's ocean basins and conti nents, and that the grand features of the Earth's surface are the product of ongoing large-scale horizontal motions. Some of these notions were put forward earlier in this century (by A. Wegener, in 1912, and by A. Holmes, in 1929), but most of the new ideas were an outgrowth of the study of the ocean floor after World War II. In its impact on the earth sciences, the plate tectonics revolution is comparable to the upheaval wrought by the ideas of Charles Darwin (1809-1882), which started the intense discussion on the evolution of the biosphere that has recently heated up again. Darwin drew his inspiration from observations on island life made during the voyage of the Beagle (1831-1836), and his work gave strong impetus to the first global oceanographic expedition, the voyage of HMS Challenger (1872- 1876). Ever since, oceanographic research has been intimately associ ated with fundamental advances in the knowledge of Earth. This should come as no surprise. After all, our planet's surface is mostly ocean.""",3.55,11,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3540601910.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3540601910.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/3540601910.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

According to Chomsky, ""propaganda is to democracy as the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state,"" and the mass media is the primary vehicle for delivering propaganda in the United States. From an examination of how Woodrow Wilsonâ€™s Creel Commission ""succeeded, within six months, in turning a pacifist population into a hysterical, war-mongering population,"" to Bush Sr.'s war on Iraq, Chomsky examines how the mass media and public relations industries have been used as propaganda to generate public support for going to war. Chomsky further touches on how the modern public relations industry has been influenced by Walter Lippmannâ€™s theory of ""spectator democracy,"" in which the public is seen as a ""bewildered herd"" that needs to be directed, not empowered; and how the public relations industry in the United States focuses on ""controlling the public mind,"" and not on informing it.

2070327167,PoÃ©sies,StÃ©phane MallarmÃ©,1992,Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press,Cultural,"-Â«Comprendre MallarmÃ© a toujours paru difficile. Mais c'est que dÃ¨s qu'il s'agit de lui, qui fut un des fondateurs de notre modernitÃ©, il ne faut pas hÃ©siter Ã  se rÃ©fÃ©rer pourtant Ã  ce qui peut en paraÃ®tre si Ã©loignÃ© : les grandes structures de la pensÃ©e archaÃ¯que. ,Celle-ci, en effet, cette longue et omniprÃ©sente tradition qu'a commencÃ© de dÃ©manteler en Europe Ã  la fin de la Renaissance le nouvel esprit scientifique, ancrait le besoin de connaÃ®tre dans l'existence comme elle va, autrement dit dans le temps, avec pour horizon et Ã©nigme les moyens limitÃ©s de la condition humaine, et le hasard des Ã©vÃ©nements, et la fatalitÃ© de la mort. C'est par analogie avec ses situations de l'exister quotidien que les aspects que nous dirions les plus matÃ©riels du monde Ã©taient abordÃ©s : choses que l'on percevait de ce fait comme des Ãªtres, enchaÃ®nements qui semblaient dictÃ©s par un dessein, un vouloir. Et c'est donc de par l'intÃ©rieur de l'Ã©vÃ©nement ou de l'objet qu'on avait l'impression d'accÃ©der Ã  leur raison d'Ãªtre, Ã  leur sens ; et sans avoir perdu pour autant contact avec leur apparence la plus immÃ©diatement sensorielle, alors encore non simplifiÃ©e par les instruments de mesure. Par exemple, la passiflore Ã©tait comprise, dans l'univers mÃ©diÃ©val. On avait reconnu dans ses organes floraux une reprÃ©sentation abrÃ©gÃ©e â€“ une image en miroir â€“ des instruments de la Passion, chiffres eux-mÃªmes du salut, de la Providence. Et ce savoir prÃ©servait donc toute la prÃ©sence sensible de cette fleur, il en voyait la couleur, il en respirait le parfum.,[...] Les couleurs, les odeurs, les sons restaient vifs dans l'idÃ©e de la passiflore ou du ciel Ã©toilÃ©, aussi riches ceux-ci apparaissaient-ils de significations symboliques ; et pour peu qu'on approfondÃ®t cette lecture de signes, on pouvait donc dÃ©boucher sur une expÃ©rience d'unitÃ© sans quitter le plan des rÃ©alitÃ©s sensibles : l'expÃ©rience mÃªme que MallarmÃ© dans ses premiers textes appellera une extase. ,MallarmÃ© qui a ressent durement, dÃ¨s ses dÃ©buts de poÃ¨te, que la connaissance ne s'Ã©labore plus, de notre temps, que de l'extÃ©rieur, qu'elle rÃ©ifie tout ce qu'elle touche, que les parfums, les couleurs, les sons ne soient donc pour nous que des Ã©mergences privÃ©es de tout sens profond, dÃ©sordonnÃ©es.Â» ,Yves Bonnefoy.",4.08,724,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/2070327167.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/2070327167.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/2070327167.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Written in 1513 and published in 1532, after Machivelliâ€™s death, ,The Prince, immediately provoked controversy that has continued unabated to this day. ,Defining human nature as inherently selfish, Machiavelli proposes that social conflict and violence are natural phenomena that help determine the ablest, most versatile form of government. Asserting that idealism has no place in the political arena, ,The Prince, primarily addresses a monarchâ€™s difficulties in retaining authority. Considered the first expression of political realism, it has often been accused of advocating a political philosophy in which â€œthe end justifies the means.â€ Indeed the emphasis in ,The Prince, on practical success, at the expense even of traditional moral values, earned Machiavelli a reputation for ruthlessness, deception, and cruelty. Many scholars contend, however, that the authorâ€™s pragmatic views of ethics and politics reflected the realities of his time, as exemplified by the Medici family of Florence. ,Debates about Machiavelliâ€™s theories are as lively today as they were 450 years ago, but no one questions the importance of his fundamental contribution to Western political thought. This newly translated edition also includes Machiavelliâ€™s ,Letter to Francesco Vettori,, ,The Life of Castruccio Castracani,, and excerpts from the ,Discourses on Livy,.,Wayne A.

From her well-remembered New Yorker essays about the financial demands of big-city ambition and the ethereal, strangely old-fashioned allure of cyber relationships to her dazzlingly hilarious riff in Harper's about musical passions that give way to middle-brow paraphernalia, Daum delves into the center of things while closely examining the detritus that spills out along the way. She speaks to questions at the root of the contemporary experience, from the search for authenticity and interpersonal connection in a society defined by consumerism and media; to the disenchantment of working in a ""glamour profession""; to the catastrophic effects of living among New York City's terminal hipsters. With precision and well-balanced irony, Daum implicates herself as readily as she does the targets that fascinate and horrify her. In a review of The KGB Bar Reader, in which Daphne Merkin singled out Daum's essay about the inability to mourn a friend's death, Merkin wrote: ""It's brutally quick, the way this happens, this falling in love with a writer's style.

Among countless other facts, Loewen demonstrates that Columbus and his men were far from the first to set foot in the ""New World,"" and that the peoples he encountered there did not submit to the ""god-like"" authority of him and his crewmen, but rather to the deadly forms of smallpox and bubonic plague they brought with them from Europe.,In concise, deeply engaging prose, Loewen expands on these little-discussed facts, putting them in the larger context of a discussion of ""truth"" and revisionist history.",3.98,264,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1565840089.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1565840089.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1565840089.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

From his early Prairie Houses (typified by the Robie House) to the Usonian concept home and progressive ""living architecture"" buildings to late projects like the spiral Guggenheim Museum in New York and the development of his fantastic vision of a better tomorrow via his concept of the ""living city,"" all of the phases of Wright's career are painstakingly described and illustrated herein.,Volume 1, covers the early Chicago years and the Prairie Houses, the period which provoked a profound influence on European architects. Wright's architectural work during these early years was mostly residential, as it would be throughout his career, and from his earliest work, Frank Lloyd Wright demonstrated a knowledge of and respect for natural materials. In the ten years ,between 1896 and 1906 he developed and perfected the so-called ""prairie house."", Wright believed the architect should have complete charge of architectural design, and for him this meant interior furnishings as well as exterior landscape.

1567181120,Wiccan Beliefs &amp; Practices,Gary Cantrell,2001,Llewellyn Publications,Religion,"Modern Wicca is a vibrant, uplifting nature religion practiced by hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. But wearing witchy jewelry and casting a few spells does not make one a witch, for Wicca is a lifestyle and those who walk its path have solemnly dedicated themselves to the service of the Goddess and God.,Wiccan Beliefs and Practices ,was written for the solitary witch or non-traditional small coven. Written by a Wiccan High Priest and retired aerospace engineer, ,Wiccan Beliefs & Practices, includes crucial information not found in other introductory Wiccan books, including:,Ethics of a Witch, including the Code of Chivalry How to write and develop your own spells and rituals The physically-challenged Witch Out of the broom closet: is it right for you? Know your rights: the legal protection of Wicca as a legitimate religion Author Gary Cantrell speaks from personal experience with Wiccans of all ages and degrees of physical ability, bringing you an earnest examination of modern Wiccan beliefs and a practical guide to the Craft of the Wise.,In the following excerpt, the author explains why he chose to come out of the broom closet.,I elected to reveal my practice of witchcraft publicly simply because I personally feel that the time for intentionally hiding ourselves has come to an end. We are practitioners of a kind, gentle, and peace-loving religion. We are not the bloodthirsty or depraved, orgiastic fanatics all too often portrayed by the entertainment and news media. The general public has been misled about witchcraft for over a thousand years, and now with our numbers reaching an all-time high, possibly in excess of one million people worldwide, we need to stand up and set that record straight.,We are out there by the hundreds upon hundreds of thousands. We are in the arts, the sciences, and the humanities. We are law enforcement officers, engineers, builders, doctors, and farmers. We are a legally recognized religion under the protection of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and our isolation from the rest of the religious community should and must come to an end. With the phenomenal growth of witchcraft since the 1970s and with the free and easy interchange of information afforded to us by things like the Internet, that time will come to pass and it will happen soon. It may be happening now.",3.78,126,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567181120.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567181120.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567181120.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1559706708,Napoleon : A Biography,Frank McLynn,2003,Arcade Publishing,Biography,"Napoleon Bonaparte's character and achievements have always divided critics and commentators. In this compelling biography, Frank McLynn draws on the most recent scholarship and throws a brilliant light on this most paradoxical of men--as military leader, lover, and emperor. Tracing Napoleon's extraordinary career, McLynn examines the Promethean legend from his Corsican roots, through the years of the French Revolution and his military triumphs, to his coronation in 1804 and ultimate defeat and imprisonment. McLynn brilliantly reveals the extent to which Napoleon was both existential hero and plaything of Fate; mathematician and mystic; intellectual giant and moral pygmy; great man and deeply flawed human being.,-This massive biography not only sets forth Napoleon's deeds and acts but explores the motivations behind them. Readers always want to understand what makes great historical figures tick.,-Impeccably researched and clearly written for the general public.,-Gives the reader an eagle's-eye view of European history during the 40-year period of Napoleon's reign.,- Hardcover ISBN: 1559706317",3.84,490,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1559706708.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1559706708.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1559706708.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Tarcher,Science,"Though many factors have been proposed to explain the failure of Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign, it has also been linked to something as small as a button - a tin button, the kind that fastened everything from the greatcoats of Napoleon's officers to the trousers of his foot soldiers. When temperatures drop below 56Â°F, tin crumbles into powder. Were the soldiers of the Grande ArmÃ©e acutee fatally weakened by cold because the buttons of their uniforms fell apart? How different our world might be if tin did not disintegrate at low temperatures and the French had continued their eastward expansion! , This fascinating book tells the stories of seventeen molecules that, like the tin of those buttons, greatly influenced the course of history. These molecules provided the impetus for early exploration and made possible the ensuing voyages of discovery. They resulted in grand feats of engineering and spurred advances in medicine; lie behind changes in gender roles, in law, and in the environment; and have determined what we today eat, drink, and wear. , Showing how a change as small as the position of an atom can lead to enormous differences in the properties of a substance, the authors reveal the astonishing chemical connections among seemingly unrelated events. ,Napoleon's Buttons, offers a novel way to understand how our contemporary world works and how our civilization has been shaped over time.",3.97,5328,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1585422207.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1585422207.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1585422207.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

But where do words such as Saturn, PowerBook, and Tylenol originate? How did we come to ""xerox"" our paperwork and ""have a cup of Starbucks""? Which names work, and why? For journalist Alex Frankel, what began as an exercise in curiosity--tracing the evolution of a handful of the most successful brand names from the marketplace to their places of origin--resulted in a year-long journey in which he gained access to a previously undiscovered world of forward-thinking creatives: professional namers, the unique group of marketers responsible for inventing words that ultimately become a part of our everyday vocabularies.,Wordcraft, is Frankel's in-depth look at how companies name themselves and their products and, in the process of defining their business through words and language, develop narratives that define the way they present themselves to the outside world. His lively, fly-on-the-wall narrative takes us into the conference rooms of Lexicon, the world's largest professional naming firm, where we see how the highly successful email pager known as the BlackBerry got its name. We travel to Germany to learn how Porsche approached the naming of its controversial SUV, a car that challenged the company's famously sporty image. The creative team behind Viagra explains how they took a completely fabricated word and turned it into a powerful idea. We witness how IBM assumed ownership of the word and story of ""e-business"" and in so doing turned around its corporate mindset and returned to a dominant industry position.,The book is filled with stories about how things get their names, but it's not just tales of business meetings and product launches. We meet the characters who populate the naming world, ""information age neologists"" like freelance namer Andrea Michaels, who plays professional Scrabble and competes on TV game shows when not brainstorming for corporate clients. And we learn about the civic unrest that erupted in Denver when the naming rights for Mile High Stadium were sold. Frankel laces his narrative with cultural and historical references and quotations from thinkers as diverse as Marianne Moore and Lawrence Lessig, all of which add a layer of richness and depth to this book's multithreaded and engaging stories.,For anyone intrigued by the power of words and ideas in today's marketplace, ,Wordcraft, is a captivating tour of a fascinating world.,From the Hardcover edition.",3.41,92,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051045.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051045.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051045.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

She shows us how we can use the cards to trigger awareness in ourselves of troubling aspects of our lives and histories, and then go beyond discovery to use the cards as tools for healing. This is part of the work that needs to be done with tarot in this new century."" â€”Rachel Pollack, author of 78 Degrees of Wisdom and the forthcoming Shining Tribe Tarot,Deep within our psyches, the unconscious holds our forbidden feelings, secret wishes, and creative urges. Over time, these ""dark forces"" take on a life of their own and form the shadowâ€”a powerful force of unresolved inner conflicts and unexpressed emotions that defies our efforts to control it.,The shadow takes its shape from a menagerie of archetypes, each recognizable throughout time and around the worldâ€”troubling characters who thrive within our persona. The shadow is saboteur, martyr, victim, addict, sadist, masochist, or tyrant; all the dark figures that prey on the lighter qualities of the human personality. The shadow also represents those latent talents and positive traits that were banished from us at some time along our life path: artistic, musical, athletic, or creative talents. An undeveloped ability, a dream that has gone unexpressed, a fantasy of what might have beenâ€”these too make up the personal shadow, the lost parts of ourselves.,Tarot Shadow Work shows you how to free yourself from the shackles of the shadow's power. Through tarot work, journaling, meditation, creative visualization, and dream work, you will bring the shadow into the light. This book is ideal for those who are in recovery from a serious addiction or illness, as well as any person seeking a deeper understanding of his or her true self.,By exploring the dark and uncharted territory of the unconscious mind, you will work towards understanding and integrating the shadow. No prior knowledge of the tarot is required. You will learn to use the cards as a tool to help you break free from negative patterns and self-destructive behavior. Once we realize that we are made of both light and darkness, life will start to make sense. When we accept our dual natures, we stop sabotaging our own efforts and learn to be compassionate with others and with ourselves.",3.91,88,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567184081.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567184081.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567184081.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1593080425,BNCTP: SELECTED STORIES OF O. HENRY (B&amp;N Classics Trade Paper),Victoria Blake,2003,Barnes &amp; Noble,Classics,"O. Henry originated the humorous, energetic tale that ends with an ironic, even shocking twist. In ""After Twenty Years,"" for example, two boys agree to meet at a particular spot exactly twenty years later. Both are faithful, but in the intervening years one boy has turned into a criminal, the other into a policeman. Behind the rendezvous lurks a powerful dramatic situation with a fascinating moral dilemma--all in a few brief pages. ,This is just one of the many literary gems in Selected Stories of O. Henry, a collection of forty-five of O. Henry's most renowned and entertaining short stories. Each one offers insights into human nature and the ways it is affected by love, jealousy, poverty, gentility, and the all-pervading reality of people conning people--themes that ran through the author's own life. Born William Sidney Porter, O. Henry started writing while in prison for embezzlement. Later he moved to New York, and his tales romanticizing the commonplace, particularly the life of ordinary New Yorkers, became highly popular. The most widely read author of his time, O. Henry died penniless but left behind a wealth of short stories that endure as hallmarks of the genre.",4.17,17373,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1593080425.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1593080425.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1593080425.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1573245097,The Art of Pilgrimage: The Seeker's Guide to Making Travel Sacred,Phil Cousineau,2000,Conari Press,Travel,"For the intrepid traveler, there are more resources than ever before. But what about the traveler who is at a crossroads in life, longing for something else, neither diversion nor distraction, beyond escape and mere entertainment? What about those eager for a journey that is personally meaningful? For millennia this cry has been answered by pilgrimage, the transformative journey to a sacred center. The ancients referred to this path as the Way of the Pilgrim, an acknowledgement of travel for the sake of devotion, commitment, even penance to a holy site, a destination that blazes with meaning -- in short, a journey of risk and renewal. ""The Art of Pilgrimage"" is a guide for travelers ready to embark on a sacred journey and for armchair travelers curious to know what it means to travel with soulful purpose. Geared toward the modern-day pilgrim looking for inspiration and a few spiritual tools for the road, it combines stories, myths, parables, and quotes from famous travelers of the past with practical suggestions and contemporary accounts from people traveling the sacred way today. Not a guidebook to holy sites, this book is designed to help travelers focus on the purpose and intention at every satge of their journey no matter where they are going. ""The Art of Pilgrimage"" includes stories of traditional pilgrimages such as those to Canterbury or Jerusalem, but also ones to Shakespeare's home, Graceland, or the ""Field of Dreams"" in Iowa. Phil Cousineau recounts anecdotes from his own travels covering over 50 countries and offers readers the advice he gives when leading tours for the Joseph Campbell Foundation.",4.11,808,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1573245097.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1573245097.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1573245097.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

In every case, Faunce portrays [Lucrezia] believably, with wit and sensitivity.â€--Library Journal,Hundreds of years after her death, Lucrezia Borgia remains one of the most enigmatic and notorious women of history, accused of incest, of poisoning her rivals, and even of murdering her own father. Born into scandal, she was the daughter of the treacherous Cardinal Roderigo Borgia, who would later be crowned Pope Alexander VI. When her father ascended the papal throne, young Lucreziaâ€™s life changed forever. From then on, Lucrezia would be unable to escape the political ambitions of her father and her brother, the bloodthirsty Cesare Borgia.,In an era when the Vatican was as decadent and violent as any royal court, Lucrezia was its crown princess. Famed for her beauty, she was a valuable pawn in the marriage game, and Alexander VI would use her to create one alliance after another. When her kindly first husband no longer suited the Popeâ€™s needs, Lucreziaâ€™s virginity was restored by papal decree (her new maidenhood was declared â€œmiraculousâ€), and she was married off again, this time to a man she truly loved, Alfonso, Prince of Naples. But her joy was short-lived. Alfonso loathed her brother and refused to participate in the Popeâ€™s imperial schemes, which threatened to tear apart the Vaticanâ€™s political alliances--and Lucreziaâ€™s happy marriage. ,In this unforgettable debut, John Faunce perfectly captures the rotten decadence of the Borgiasâ€™ papal court and the inner steel of Lucrezia Borgia, one of historyâ€™s great survivors.,â€œFascinating...a searing portrait of an intelligent woman, cunning enough to shape her own bizarre destiny.â€--Booklist",3.26,411,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051223.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051223.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1400051223.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Each gallery section concludes helpfully with notes about smaller objects and displays that are not to be missed.,The final two sections are devoted to the museum's sprawling thirty-building Paul E.

When he was named West Africa bureau chief by the Associated Press, Stewart accepted his new assignment with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. He was one of the AP's youngest bureau chiefs, and over the next year he reported from the front lines of the war-ravaged countries of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone and coordinated news coverage of some twenty-three others. AMBUSHED is a fascinating, in-depth look at the extraordinary day-to-day life of a war correspondent. Stewart presents a compelling portrait of the often surreal world that journalists inhabit as they bear witness to violence and give voice to the unspeakable. Appalled by the level of cruelty he witnessed, Stewart was shocked by the indifference of the outside world. Though his stories were sometimes buried deep inside the daily papers, or published not at all, he kept reporting the truth. When armed rebels entered Sierra Leone's besieged capital of Freetown, Stewart and two of his colleagues were ambushed while driving down the street on assignment. One of his colleagues was killed instantly, and Stewart, shot in the head, had a twenty-percent chance of surviving. Astonishingly, he did.

This is an excellent book to have, whether you have a child now, or are planning on having one soon. ,One of the problems faced by all parents is what to say when you get those ""tough"" questions from youngsters. You have to be honest, but at the same time it is important to speak to them at their level so they are sure to understand. How do you answer when a child asks, ""Will you die? What happens when you die? Do animals have spirits?"" With older children the questions can become even more difficult. ""My boyfriend/girlfriend wants me to have sex. What should I do?"" The answers suggested in this book are not of the this-is-what-you-must-say type, but rather are open-ended. Madden points out possible responses and problems with the answers you may consider giving. In this way your responses can be totally your own. ,Another important aspect of raising a Pagan child is being able to help that child develop her or his psychic and magical abilities. Young children may not have the ability to concentrate for long periods of time, and quick-witted older children may become bored. The author suggests many fun activities which turn psychic, magical, and spiritual development into games. This will allow your child to develop and keep those abilities without becoming bored or disinterested. ,What should you do if your child decides to look at another religion or become a member of another religion? This has never been dealt with in a book for Pagan parents. Until now. Until here. Until ""Pagan Parenting. ,""In some ways it is impossible to fully describe this book. It covers so many things about raising Pagan children that to focus on one leaves out the others. To find out how important this book is, you just have to read it.

It is a joyful embracing of the feminine. It is an acknowledgment that we are created in ""Her"" image, and as such we share in the divine nature. The world shifts when we feel Her presence. She is both immanent and transcendent. She can be known in the cry of birds in the springtime; the full fruited trees of summer; autumn's dying breath; the winter's barren landscape. She is powerful and gentle; forgiving and forbidding. She is the gateway to life but with that gift comes the knowledge that we shall return to Her in death, only to be born again in another body, in another time. She weaves us into life and into death with determined and skillful fingers. She unfolds the cycles of our lives as we watch the unfolding of the cycle of the earth, of the seasons, of our very days. And we are never alone. We shine forth like stars in her eyes. And, created in her image, we are powerful, beautiful beings full of the capacity to love and show great compassion.

A team of British Special Forces commandos parachutes into the high peaks of the Austrian Alps with the mission of stealing into an invulnerable alpine castleâ€”accessible only by aerial gondolaâ€”the headquarters of Nazi intelligence.

1891480022,Dancing With Demons,Lucy Taylor,1999,"Obsidian Books, Etc",Horror,"
  ,The Barnes & Noble Review,
, Demons. They're written of exhaustively, and often badly, in supernatural horror yarns and duplicitous comics. But in this brand-new novel by Lucy Taylor, we find a brilliant study of demons of a far more human likeness: weakness, addiction, guilt. Real consequences in a real world propel this very real and terrifying novel. There are no horns on these demons, no evocations, no arcane occult texts, and no monsters rising from flaming pentagrams. , What rises, instead, in this relentless, modern-day thriller, is a far more allegorical demon: lust. , Jessie Tauber, a recovering alcoholic/sex addict, slowly finds herself being tortured by her own self-doubt. Her addictions have caused her to lose custody of her son, Henry, and this tragedy constantly tempts her back to the liquor store to drown her sorrows. Now Henry lives with Jessie's father, an evangelical preacher, and to make matters (and Jessie's guilt) worse, Henry's already started drinking, and he's only 13 years old. , Just when Jessie's plight couldn't seem darker, the handsome and charismatic Simon enters her life like a beacon of bright light. There's an instant common bond: Simon is a recovering alcoholic himself. And he seems to understand Jessie and all the hardships she's experiencing. Indeed, after a string of relationships with men who turned out to be abusive, half-crazy heels, Simon appears to be what Jessie's never had before: Mr. Right. , But Jessie soon finds out she couldn't be more wrong, and she finds out the hard way. The suitors of her past don't know what crazy is compared to Simon....,In Lucy Taylor's ten-year track record of preeminent storytelling, she clearly outdoes herself in this grim, terrifying, and all-too-real novel. Taylor's mastery of plot, characterization, and sheer modern realism explode in this brilliant tale of taboos, betrayal, scorching sex, and outright insanity. , Taylor is also, in my opinion, a writer who weaves dark eroticism into the workings of a breakneck thriller better than any author out there. Her prose shines, crackles, and summons images that not only entertain but disturb the reader as well. , Taylor's stories make us think; they make us see more of the real world and the human condition within the covers of a book than we might have the courage to look at outside of it. Portions of this novel will shock you, some will arouse you, while others will haunt you for some time to come. In , Dancing with Demons ,, Taylor puts one foot boldly past the line that has yet to be crossed by the name-brand ""pop"" thriller authors. And she dares you to cross that line with her. , This is a powerful and serious work, and the author's deft, literate style delivers a novel as unique as it is unforgettable. Be sure, though, to brace yourself before delving into this keg-of-dynamite thriller. Demons come in all shapes and sizes, and you just might find yourself dancing with one yourself., ,Â—Edward Lee ",4.1,10,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1891480022.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1891480022.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1891480022.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1586637371,Victorian and Edwardian Ghost Stories,Richard Dalby,2002,Metro Books,Short Stories,"During the nineteenth century, ghost stories gained tremendous popularity in both Britain and the United States. Macabre and supernatural tales became a fashionable and much anticipated component of popular magazines. Writers such as Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu and Bram Stoker specialized in this genre, and successful novelists such as Charles Dickens and Harriet Beecher Stowe put aside their longer works to spin haunting short stories., Victorian & Edwardian Ghost Stories presents over forty deliciously ceric tales, from Le Fanu's ""Schalken the Painter"" to Henry James's ""The Romance of Certain Old Clothes"" to Edith Nesbit's ""The Shadow."" (Nesbit was only one of many women who were consummate practitioners of the form; several are represented here.) The most avid enthusiast of ghostly fiction is likely to discover previously unread tales mixed in among old favorites. A brief preface places each story within the context of the author's writings., Perfect bedtime reading, these classic short stories will suspend your disbelief long enough to startle your imagination and chill you to the core.",4.08,26,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1586637371.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1586637371.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1586637371.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

His family fled the Inquisition and took him to the city of Fez, in North Africa. Hasan became an itinerant merchant, and made many journeys to the East, journeys rich in adventure and observation.

1860464483,Women With Men: 3 Stories,Richard Ford,1998,Havill Pr,Fiction,"Richard Ford's ,Independence Day,--his sequel to ,The Sportswriter,, and an international bestseller--is the only novel ever to have received both the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award. Now, two years later, he reaffirms his mastery of shorter fiction with his first collection since the widely acclaimed Rock Springs, published a decade ago.,The landscape of ,Women with Men, ranges from the northern plains of Montana to the streets of Paris and the suburbs of Chicago, where Mr. Ford's various characters experience the consolations and complications that prevail in matters of passion, romance and love. A seventeen-year-old boy starting adulthood in the shadow of his parents' estrangement, a survivor of three marriages now struggling with cancer, an ostensibly devoted salesman in early middle age, an aspiring writer, a woman scandalously betrayed by her husband--they each of them contend with the vast distances that exist between those who are closest together. Whether alone, long married or newly met, they confront the obscure difference between privacy and intimacy, the fine distinction of pleasing another as opposed to oneself, and a need for reliance that is tempered by fearful vulnerability.,In three long stories, Richard Ford captures men and women at this complex and essential moment of truth--in the course of everyday life, or during a bleak Thanksgiving journey, seismic arguments, Christmas abroad, the sudden disappearance of a child, even a barroom shooting. And with peerless emotional nuance and authority he once again demonstrates, as Elizabeth Hardwick has written, ""a talent as strong and varied as American fiction has to offer.""",3.65,1579,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1860464483.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1860464483.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1860464483.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Il s'appelle Peter. Nous sommes Ã  Londres, enÂ 1887. Il fait un froid glacial. Soudain, un trait de lumiÃ¨re jaune vient terminer sa course sous son capuchon. Peter croit avoir capturÃ© une Ã©toile filante. En vÃ©ritÃ©, il s'agit d'une minuscule crÃ©ature vivante. Une fÃ©eâ€¦ Ravissante, coquette et terriblement susceptible. Et quand cette fÃ©e jette une poignÃ©e de poussiÃ¨re dans les yeux du petit garÃ§on, celui-ci se met Ã  voler dans les airs, par-dessus les toits londoniens couverts de neigeâ€¦ ,Le lecteur l'aura comprisÂ : ce petit garÃ§on n'est autre qu'un certain Peter Pan, figure lÃ©gendaire de l'imaginaire occidental, apparu dans le roman de James Matthew Barrie et adaptÃ© trÃ¨s librement en dessin animÃ© par Walt Disney.

Une Å“uvre qui s'est trÃ¨s vite imposÃ©e comme l'une des plus belles rÃ©ussites de la BD contemporaine. Tout en rendant hommage Ã  la beautÃ© de l'adaptation signÃ©e Disney, le dessinateur a optÃ© pour une vision sombre et parfois cruelle de l'Å“uvre de James Matthew Barrie. Servi par un dessin foisonnant au coup de crayon Ã©nergique, son ,Peter Pan, charrie des images fortes et tourmentÃ©es, des instantanÃ©s de sang et de violence brute qui voisinent heureusement avec des scÃ¨nes d'humour et de poÃ©sie bucolique. Le rÃ©cit dÃ©marre dans les ruelles sordides des quartiers misÃ©reux du Londres victorien, loin, bien loin des maisons confortables chÃ¨res Ã  Disney. Peter est un gamin rejetÃ© par sa mÃ¨re. Un enfant des rues qui fait oublier leurs malheurs Ã  ses copains d'infortune en leur racontant avec talent des histoires Ã  rÃªver debout. De quoi leur faire croire que la vie n'est peut-Ãªtre pas si moche que Ã§a... Le soir venu, il trouve Ã©coute et rÃ©confort auprÃ¨s de mister Kundal, homme bon et instruit qui lui offre Ã  manger. Et qui lui apporte aussi les nourritures spirituelles indispensables Ã  son dÃ©veloppement intellectuel en l'initiant aux mystÃ¨res de la mythologie grecque. Au passage, il lui parle de son pÃ¨re â€“ une scÃ¨ne qui prendra toute sa force dans ,Crochet,, le cinquiÃ¨me et avant-dernier volume de la sÃ©rieâ€¦ Entrer dans le ,Peter Pan, de RÃ©gis Loisel, c'est s'embarquer pour une odyssÃ©e fascinante Ã  travers les mÃ©andres de l'imaginaire.

1842770772,Walking Through Fire: A Life of Nawal El Saadawi,Nawal Sadawi,2002,Zed Books,Biography,"In ,A Daughter of Isis,, Nawal El Saadawi painted a beautifully textured portrait of the childhood that moulded her into a novelist and fearless campaigner for freedom and the rights of women. ,Walking through Fire, takes up the story of her extraordinary life.,Famous for her novels, short stories and writings on women, Saadawi is known as the first Arab woman to have written about sex and its relation to economics and politics. Imprisoned under Sadat for her opinions, she has continued to fight against all forms of discrimination based on class, gender, nationality, race or religion.,This autobiography shows the passion for justice that has shaped her life and her writing. We read about her as a rural doctor, trying to help a young girl escape from a terrible fate imposed on her by a brutal male tyranny. We follow her attempts to set up women's organizations and to publish magazines later banned by the authorities or endangered by fundamentalist threats. We travel with her into exile after the publication of her name on a death list. We witness her first marriage to a freedom fighter hounded into drug addiction by a system that has no mercy. We share her struggle against her 'false self' and a second husband who offers her financial security and comfort - provided she stops writing. We live the beautiful moments of her third marriage with a man released after fourteen years of imprisonment and hard labour - their love, companionship and shared struggle.,Nawal El Saadawi has carved a place for herself in the universal struggle against oppression. 'Words should not seek to please, to hide the wounds in our bodies, or the shameful moments in our lives', she says. 'They may hurt, give us pain, but they can also provoke us to question what we have accepted for thousands of years.'",3.85,131,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1842770772.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1842770772.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1842770772.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

Penny Rimbaud, founder, lyricist, and drummer of Crass, a band unique in the history of rock 'n' roll. Crass took the idealism of punk seriously. When Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten screamed ""No Future"" the challenge was taken. In the space of seven short years, from 1977 to their breakup in 1984, Crass almost single-handedly breathed life back into the then moribund peace and anarchist movements. They birthed a huge underground network of do-it-yourself activism, fanzines, record labels, activist action groups, and concert halls. While remaining on their own independent record label, and steadfastly refusing any interviews with the major press, they managed to sell literally millions of records. Their political ""pranks"" included the now infamous ""KGB tapes,"" trumpeted among others, on the front page of the ,New York Times,, and the duping of ,Total Loving, magazine into including a Crass song (ranting against the patriarchy of marriage) as the ""perfect song to play on your wedding day."" In this book, Penny takes us from his strict lower-middle class childhood and his experiences in art school to the Crass years, the hippies, and Free Festivals, including the now legendary, illegal Stonehenge Festival, of which Rimbaud was a cofounder.,Shibboleth, also includes, for the first time, the full story of Wally Hopeâ€”""The Last of the Hippies,"" close friend of Rimbaud, cofounder of the Stonehenge Festival, and who was murdered by the State while incarcerated in a mental institution.",4.02,210,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1873176406.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1873176406.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1873176406.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

As a user, you can make any kind of customization you want, from choosing the keystrokes that invoke your favorite commands to creating a whole new work environment that looks like nothing ever developed before. It's all in Emacs Lisp -- and in this short but fast-paced book.,GNU Emacs is more than an editor; it's a programming environment, a communications package, and many other things. To provide such a broad range of functions, it offers a full version of the Lisp programming language -- something much more powerful than the little macro languages provided in other editors (including older versions of Emacs). GNU Emacs is a framework in which you can create whole new kinds of editors or just alter aspects of the many functions it already provides.,In this book, Bob Glickstein delves deep into the features that permit far-reaching Emacs customizations. He teaches you the Lisp language and discusses Emacs topics (such as syntax tables and macro templates) in easy-to-digest portions. Examples progress in complexity from simple customizations to extensive major modes.,You will learn how to write interactive commands, use hooks and advice, perform error recovery, manipulate windows, buffers, and keymaps, exploit and alter Emacs's main loop, and more. Each topic is explored through realistic examples and a series of successive refinements that illustrate not only the Emacs Lisp language, but the development process as well, making learning pleasant and natural.",3.8,55,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1565922611.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1565922611.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1565922611.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

That is until 1904, when the disease broke out in a household in Oyster Bay, Long Island. Authorities suspected the family cook, Mary Mallon, of being a carrier. But before she could be tested, the woman, soon to be known as Typhoid Mary, had disappeared. Over the course of the next three years, Mary worked at several residences, spreading her pestilence as she went. In 1907, she was traced to a home on Park Avenue, and taken into custody. Institutionalized at Riverside Hospital for three years, she was released only when she promised never to work as a cook again. She promptly disappeared.,For the next five years Mary worked in homes and institutions in and around New York, often under assumed names. In February 1915, a devastating outbreak of typhoid at the Sloane Hospital for Women was traced to her. She was finally apprehended and reinstitutionalized at Riverside Hospital, where she would remain for the rest of her life.,Typhoid Mary, is the story of her infamous life. Anthony Bourdain reveals the seedier side of the early 1900s, and writes with his renowned panache about life in the kitchen, uncovering the horrifying conditions that allowed the deadly spread of typhoid over a decade. ,Typhoid Mary, is a true feast for history lovers and Bourdain lovers alike.",3.6,3503,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1582341338.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1582341338.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1582341338.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

She recounts the day-to-day realities of living in a city under siege, where food has to be consumed or thrown out because there is no way to preserve it, where eventually people cannot sleep until the nightly bombing commences, where packs of stray dogs roam the streets (and provide her own dog Salvi with a harem) and rats invade homes. Through it all, al-Radi works at her art and gathers with neighbors and family for meals and other occasions, happy and sad. ,In the wake of the war, al-Radi lives in semi-exile, shuttling between Beirut and Amman, travelling to New York, London, Mexico and Yemen. As she suffers the indignities of being an Iraqi in exile, al-Radi immerses us in a way of life constricted by the stress and effects of war and embargoes, giving texture to a reality we have only been able to imagine before now.

1903650135,Full Time: the Secret Life of Tony Cascarino,Paul Kimmage,2001,Simon &amp; Schuster (Trade Division),Biography,"Full Time: the Secret Life of Tony Cascarino, is the most praised football autobiography in a very long time. Reviewers' jaws dropped at ""the searing honesty ... and the breathless style"" (,The Saturday Times,); ,The Observer Sport Monthly, gasped ""It's ,Angela's Ashes, with half-time oranges ... a footballer's autobiography like no other. The most astonishing sports book of the year."" ""Autobiography"" of course means ghost-written: though told in the first person it was put together by award-winning Irish journalist Paul Kimmage, whose ,Rough Ride, won the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award in 1990. Making the book compulsively readable Kimmage structured it brilliantly, guarding the series of secrets that Cascarino reveals so that the reader is tantalised by cryptic glimpses then made to wait until each revelation in turn is suddenly unveiled. What are these secrets? Suffice to say that some are personal, some professional, some minor and quirky, one major enough to generate heated debate in the press. At times the book reads like the confession of a man who's lived with too much guilt for too long., Throughout, the book maintains a very high standard. It veers towards the blandness for which footballers' autobiographies are famous only when the author is discussing his friends, to whom he is commendably loyal. As for his managers, there are several memorable portraits. In the case of Jack Charlton it's open hero-worship, even when he felt hard done by. Relations with Glenn Hoddle were a very different story. ""He was probably the unfunniest man I have ever known. He was also completely besotted with himself ... When you stepped offside with Glenn, there was nothing to do but accept your fate and hope that you returned in the next life as talented and as perfect as him."", ,The Guardian, said, ""Compared with the standard-issue footballer's autobiography, this is Tolstoy."" Perhaps not quite, but it's brilliant storytelling, and gives a shockingly honest portrait of one footballer and his world. --,David Pickering, ",4.09,704,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1903650135.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1903650135.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1903650135.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1589636147,In Desert and Wilderness,Henryk Sienkiewicz,2001,Fredonia Books (NL),Classics,"In the tradition of Robinson Crusoe and Treasure Island comes a Sienkiewicz novel for readers of all ages! This thrilling adventure saga and coming-of-age tale sets two young children, Stas Tarkowski, fourteen, and Nelly Rawlison, eight, within the reaches of Africa's desert storms, the ravages of hunger, and threatening jungles filled with vicious animals and warring tribes. Everything for the pair seemed comfortable and safe in Egypt. But when the children are separated from their fathers during a vacation along the Nile, they become pawns in a treacherous plot and are abducted by the vengeful followers of the Mahdi. Joined in their trek by two African children, Kali and Mea, and together with the aid of a faithful dog, Saba, and a mighty elephant, King, the unlikely troop makes its way through deep Africa while facing perilous situations that would render helpless even grown men and women. Throughout this enthralling novel, author Sienkiewicz paints the vivid scenery of what was then known as ""the dark continent,"" a land filled with unknown peoples, primordial landscapes, tall and deep jungles, uncharted rivers and mountains. Political instability, then as now, could make entire regions impassable. In the 1880s one such crisis, a rebellion led by ""the Mahdi,"" threatened to turn a large part of the continent into a hell of destruction and carnage. It is in such a background that Henryk Sienkiewicz, the master storyteller and winner of the 1905 Nobel Prize for literature, placed two European children - the heroes of this engaging tale. For Henryk Sienkiewicz, In Desert and Wilderness represented a final triumph; this was the last novel he would complete. Sienkiewicz, who had visited Africa in 1891, successfully recreates in the book the beauty he encountered amid the continent's entrancing landscape. Written over eighty years ago for a younger audience, but appealing to all ages, In Desert and Wilderness remains a literary treasure in Poland.

1567314090,The Assassination of Lincoln: History and Myth,Lloyd Lewis,2000,MJF Books,History,"Lincoln looms over us today, much larger than life, and is typically represented in the somber tone and grand mood of the imposing Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., a building which in its stately magnificence and awesome dignity indeed recalls the temples of the ancient Greeks to their gods Poseidon and Zeus. Abraham Lincoln is not just another President to us; he has become virtually a god.,It was not always so. During his tenure, Lincoln was at times very unpopular on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line, and was widely insulted for stupidity, vacillations, extremism, moderation, disregard for human life, even ugliness. It is perhaps not so surprising that he should be appreciated so deeply today; only in distant retrospect can something as cataclysmic and divisive as the Civil War be understood and assessed. However, the deification of Lincoln began long before today's cool historical assessment; it began immediately with his assassination.,The assassination of Lincoln changed his place in history irrevocably, transforming him from a cunning politician into a selfless martyr, and the mist of myth was thrown up around him almost instantly, virtually issuing from the barrel of the assassin's gun.,This unique book, first published in the nineteen-twenties, was the first, and remains perhaps the best, telling of the tale of Lincoln's death and the events immediately following it. Written by a scholar familiar with Frazier's famous Golden Bough but also possessing a journalist's ear for a great yarn and reporter's skeptical nature, it combines the best of all three: journalism, mythology, and history.",3.44,27,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567314090.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567314090.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1567314090.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

So he's eager to accept an invitation to play against the East St. Louis Cubs, a black semi-pro team, even though he knows he'll be taking the biggest risk of his career. Baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis doesn't want white major leaguers on the same field with black ball players. The only solution is for Mickey to play under an assumed name.,But it's April, 1922, and Mickey is about to discover there's more at stake than winning a baseball game. East St. Louis is a city scarred by the events of 1917, when white residents massacred their black neighbors in the worst explosion of racial violence in American history. Five years later, lingering shadows of hate still hover over the community -- and when pitcher Slip Crawford leads his black team to victory, the Ku Klux Klan make their presence known, and Crawford is found dead.,Now, everything Mickey has ever fought for and everything he has ever believed will be challenged. From a first hand view of segregation to meetings with stars of the new Negro National League -- including Cool Papa Bell and Oscar Charleston -- to a KKK rally in Indiana, Mickey sees a side of American life he's never experienced before.",4.03,264,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575664550.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575664550.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1575664550.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg

1578514878,Leading Quietly,Joseph L. Badaracco Jr.,2002,Harvard Business School Press,Nonfiction,"Most of us think of leaders as courageous risk takers, orchestrators of major events. In a word: heroes. Although such figures are inspiring, Joseph Badaracco argues that their larger-than-life accomplishments are not what makes the world work. What does, he says, is the sum of millions of small yet consequential decisions that individuals working far from the limelight make every day. Badaracco calls them ""quiet leaders""--people who choose responsible, behind-the-scenes action over public heroism to resolve tough leadership challenges. Quiet leaders don't fit the stereotype of the bold and gutsy leader, and they don't want to. What they want is to do the ""right thing""--for their organizations, their coworkers, and themselves--but inconspicuously and without casualties. Drawing from extensive research, Badaracco presents eight practical yet counter-intuitive guidelines for situations in which right and wrong seem like moving targets. Compelling stories illustrate how these ""nonheroes"" succeed by managing their political capital, buying themselves time, bending the rules, and more. From the executive suite to the office cubicle--Leading Quietly shows how patient, everyday efforts can add up to a better company and a better world.",3.57,317,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1578514878.01.THUMBZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1578514878.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg,http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1578514878.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg
